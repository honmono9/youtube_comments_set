It was fun changing between them and getting different powers and seeing how they worked.. I liked that they each had their own little niche things.The raids also were enjoyable to me.. I raid at a mythic level and got CE in all but Castle cause diff guild. Obviously there are some fights I didn't enjoy but most were good. SOFO did seem like it should have been 2 raids and not 1. Shadowlands was also a great time for my class in M+. I was able to push for title which holds a sense of acomplishment for me.\n\nThe main thing I had a problem with was a lot of story elements. As I said ideas of covenants were cool but the story wasn't great in many areas. They did my girl Sylvanas dirty between BFA and SL.. did not like what they did to Arthas. Lotsa other things but I digress.  \n\nAs for the addon thing sorry but they should have made their own system alongside it. Getting rid of many is not the play but thats a different topic completly so I will hold my tongue here on this one. Only mentioned it because it was briefly brought up. \n\nI've played FF but more casually. I 100% agree most of the story is amazing. I haven't played the new expansion ppl complain about it yet though so we shall see.\nFF housing upset me cause I felt beholden to never cancel my sub when I needed a break cause housing is hard to get. Then if it goes away you lose your hard work. I am loving WoW's housing so far and tbh the tools feel so much better to me. If I did ever take a break I can keep my hard work and easily get a house again and when I plop it down the work I put in won't vanish.\n\nThe main point I agree on is that competition is good. It makes games better and all in all it is usually a win for both communities. Without healthy competition companies get complacent.",

I would have to make a dizzying number of alts and play in several different 'gamemodes' to actually experience it. I'd have to make an alt in classic, an alt in the 'remix', and then make several alts in retail to play through all the chromie-time modules.\n\nAnd even then?

Midnight will either make or break them and you can bet Micro$oft is carefully checking every metric. If they don't see a turnabout in Midnight, The Last Titan WILL be the last expansion. Blizzard has never done an original idea of their own, their trick is pulling ideas and systems from other MMOs and putting their own spin on them, usually making them more accessible. What lets them down is the game has basically no narrative worth caring about. Characterisation is dogwater, you have inexplicable stories that not even the MCU could make worse. The soul of the game is quite literally being sucked out of it.\n\nSquare-Enix is set with a completely different set of problems. Their team can cook when they're given the direction. Dawntrail was basically made without oversight from Yoshi P (man had to basically split his team to get both that and FF16 finished and out). SE however is a Japanese company - which are NOTORIOUSLY slow to react to any sort of criticism beyond platitudes. The fact that he's actually come out and said recently that he knows there are problems suggests the higher ups in the company have shit the bed. Not that it won't make much difference unless they change core systems of the game. No one cares about classes being tuned (you don't see damage meters anyway so what's the point?) The UI, the inventory system, the transmog/glamor system, the housing system needs to be fixed. They've dropped feelers about saying yes they're addressing some of this but because SE works on basically production line philosophy anything already baked in won't be changed until the following expansion in a major way until then.\n\nTL;DR? Square Enix has greater potential, greater spirit, but mechanically is being hamstrung. Even Dawntrail's story is better than anything Blizzard has churned out in the last 10 years.\nBlizzard though? WoW is a slick game with rewarding and meaningful content loops, it has better class design (even if there is homogenization on a greater scale). But they've crippled their creative output. No one cares about anything but the pretty loot you get in your vault.",

                    "textDisplay": "After thinking about it, I came to conclusion that this video is simply short sighted. You are looking at FFXIV through the perspective of WoW instead of looking at FFXIV from the perspective of FFXIV (ARR onwards).\nThe issue of story not landing is not the main issue why people compare the game to Shadowlands to try to make a point of how they feel about the game. However, this video mostly discusses story and does not go into the actual issues of the game that have compiled over a decade.\n\nThe game is extremely not alt friendly. The whole point of \"play all jobs on one character\" falls flat the moment you get into savage. I am a great healer and caster, but I can't gear both once the tier starts due to how gearing works - on average one job takes around 6-8 weeks to gear up, and if you are doing content in PF, it can take twice as long due to not getting loot and having to buy pieces, twines and shines with books. Tomes are timegated to 450 a week when we have 21 battle job, and frequently the jobs in the same gear category do not share gear either due to melds. Though for more casual people that is not an issue, it is something that cannot be just disregarded. This is especially important for things like preparing for ultimates on content. People have been asking to change this for multiple expansions to no avail.\n\nHomogenisation is at its peak. It might be difficult to notice when you only dip into a few jobs, but once you've leveled them all, you notice how weird it is that you can take any tank and use exactly the same keybinds for not base of their kits: short mit, 40% mit, invuln, single target 123, some sort of resource spender, aoe 12 and aoe spender. Not even talking about role actions, as it's separate 7 identical buttons for all.\nYou might be more familiar with scholar, but have you tried playing sage? They have their own version of soil on exactly the same cooldown, same for whispering dawn, single target/aoe shields, aoe in melee, lustrate version etc. You can use baseline keybinds for both, and it's not even going into discussions that all healers have the same basic loop of 111111 with some dot in between.\nCasters have been in a weird state for forever due to usually competing for one slot, and yet the role got a split in DT with \"support casters\" and \"dps casters\" that unless you are running double caster, one caster will just overshadow everything for an entire tier. Just look how PCT was dominating until 7.2 and since then BLM is the dominant one with the other casters barely seeing play.\nPhys ranged are so unpopular that a lot of groups decide to just ignore the 1% and instead run two casters. Machinist has not had a tier where it was excellent and wanted over other phys ranged for literally multiple expansions.",
                    "textOriginal": "After thinking about it, I came to conclusion that this video is simply short sighted. You are looking at FFXIV through the perspective of WoW instead of looking at FFXIV from the perspective of FFXIV (ARR onwards).\nThe issue of story not landing is not the main issue why people compare the game to Shadowlands to try to make a point of how they feel about the game. However, this video mostly discusses story and does not go into the actual issues of the game that have compiled over a decade.\n\nThe game is extremely not alt friendly. The whole point of \"play all jobs on one character\" falls flat the moment you get into savage. I am a great healer and caster, but I can't gear both once the tier starts due to how gearing works - on average one job takes around 6-8 weeks to gear up, and if you are doing content in PF, it can take twice as long due to not getting loot and having to buy pieces, twines and shines with books. Tomes are timegated to 450 a week when we have 21 battle job, and frequently the jobs in the same gear category do not share gear either due to melds. Though for more casual people that is not an issue, it is something that cannot be just disregarded. This is especially important for things like preparing for ultimates on content. People have been asking to change this for multiple expansions to no avail.\n\nHomogenisation is at its peak.

I say  pay attention to who they announce will be writing the story  next expansion. As much as we  all want Ishikawa to do it, she has a new role and they can't keep going to her to turn things around.",

I see people complain about empty friends lists as people just keep disappearing. \n\nWill see what they have to show in April at fanfest.",

Even now, I tend to jump into WoW (Retail) for a while, then drop out, while FFXIV remains my main game — though I play it casually and don’t engage with the hardcore content. Personally, I much prefer playing WoW Classic in a hardcore style over Retail.\r\nFrom a story and presentation standpoint, FFXIV completely outshines Blizzard in every respect. The Karesh storyline in WoW was good conceptually, but poorly presented. In FFXIV, patch 7.0 was weak in its first half, but the writing has been consistently strong since 7.2. Content‑wise, Dawntrail has been my favorite expansion so far. Thanks to the evergreen nature of FFXIV, I even went back and completed Eureka during this expansion.\r\nJobs in FFXIV remain far more engaging than any Retail WoW class, which usually rely on simple 4–6 button rotations. Even Summoner — often considered FFXIV’s most “WoW‑like” job — has more complexity than any WoW class. Boss design in this expansion has been phenomenal, and the music, unsurprisingly, has been top‑tier.\r\nThe one major drawback in FFXIV this expansion is the “Main Protagonist Syndrome.” The chosen character, Wuk Lamat, feels poorly written and comes across as a Mary Sue. On the other hand, Sphene has been very well received by the community. My server consistently has login queues, and in recent weeks I’ve noticed a population increase, with many new players (“sprouts”) joining the game.\r\nMeanwhile, WoW is also doing extremely well at the moment. I’d argue the two aren’t in direct competition, since the barrier to entry for FFXIV is much lower — especially with its availability on both console and PC. To me, Dawntrail feels far more populated than the game was back during the downtime between patches in Stormblood.",

                    "textDisplay": "Preach, how much did Square Enix pay you to make a fluff video? This video only showed me that you can't be trusted and aren't worth subscribing to. There are so many things you stated that is just not accurate, it's not even funny. I've played both of these MMOs as well as others for many years. Played FFXIV since 1.0 Alpha and WoW since late vanilla/early TBC. The only thing I see from this is that you have no clue what you're talking about, especially when it comes to FF14. have you actively played ff14 for entire expansions or just check it for a week every patch? You're definitely not playing it on a consistent basis. You'd see everyone complaining they have nothing to do. If I were to say anything, it's that FFXIV is falling downhill faster than any MMO.  Also you may want to consider a few things, FFXIV never had as many subscribers as many claim SE never released official numbers but you can tell by their financial information, FFXIV is quickly approaching an all-time low.\n\n1)  Nothing in FF14 is original, it's all stolen from elsewhere. Claiming it's a WoW thing to do is misleading as FFXIV has been doing it since Yoshida took over. The issue isn't copying  something, the issue rises from not putting their own unique spin on it, which SE did not.  Some examples include:\n- The storytelling style and a lot of the plotlines come from FF11. SE's previous MMO which is far more open ended than FF14 which is far more restrictive by design. The only \"original race\" in ff14 is the Au'ra. The original races were all from FF11 though there were no highlanders and the Roegadyn were called Galka, had tails and they were considered male as they had no gender or reproductive organs of any kind. (Their lore is also far more interesting than any racial lore in FF14.)\n- Housing came from LOTRO which released their housing in 2007. Right down to the exact number of small, medium and large houses per ward. It's also why FF14's housing is abysmal. SE just keeps it as a way to try to force people to stay subscribed out of fear of losing it and everything they put into it as if you don't claim the refund or items within 30 days after the house is demolished, you lose it all. \n- Performance as Bard? Also came from LOTRO.\n-The very gameplay structure and loop, including the loot system is taken directly from earlier WoW eras. \n- The \"Content is it's own reward\" attitude for FFXIV not giving rewards for it's content is perhaps the one FFXIV thing that's exclusive to FFXIV. Wait, some rare FFXI stuff had it too. Seems to be a Square Enix problem.\n\nThe one thing FFXIV does do: Aggressively flooding it's cash shop like a free to play Korean MMO, but FFXIV has a sub fee you have to pay. And the fans are moronic enough to make excuses for them but criticize other games for having cash shops, including F2P ones. Completely ignoring that the FFXIV cash shop outfits end up costing the same as a F2P game's outfit when you add the fact you're also paying a sub fee for 14, but not for the F2P game. WoW's cash shop items are all account wide where as not a single one of FFXIV's outfits are.\n\n2) Nothing in FF14 is \"Evergreen\" Roulettes and such only exist for incentive for people who are done everything to help others. The game would have been dead long before that if they didn't. I don't mind things like this being mentioned because this isn't a bad thing, but stop trying to sell it for something it is not. It's not \"evergreen\" That's misleading the content itself is worthless and obsolete outside of the roulette. It's only there so people don't have an even longer wait in queue because no one is doing obsolete content.\n\n3) Nothing is account wide. Do you know what he term account-wide means? I'm guessing you don't. The vast majority of people who play FF14 play multiple characters. NOTHING is account wide, it's still all locked to your character. Outside of a few account wide cash shop mounts, you'll have to do and get everything again. and Most FF14 players do actively use alts due to a massive lack of meaningful content and people being bored out of their minds.\n\nYou stating this is misleading and you're doing it on purpose. Did SE pay you to do a fluff piece for them or do you just enjoy lying to people online?\n\nThe amount of stuff stated in this video is just downright incorrect or stated in a way that leaves it open for people to take what you say at face value rather than state the truth about FFXIV. \n\nThe only thing this video showed me is you can't be trusted to give an accurate view of anything.",

Endwalker was already a VERY low point in the game. the story ended in 6.0 and we got nearly 30 months of nothing but shallow solo content while players dropped off. People were constantly talking about how FF16 gimped Endwalker, that developing 16 made Endwalker bad and Dawntrail was supposed to be a good expansion that they'd make now that 16 was over. and it just wasn't it was more blandness. Nobody is playing the content you're talking about in this video. The devs themselves have said that the content you're talking about is the least interacted with content in the game's recent history.\n\nDawntrail is Shadowlands and if 8.0 comes out and its bad it will be a closure scenario for the game and this isn't doomposting its common sense. The game is coasting on being a barbie doll game with nothing else to do but dress up and people are bored. Because its been nothing but a Barbie doll game for 5 years now and the content cycle is only getting slower and more barren\n\nWhat this video fails to understand is that if you were playing FF14 the past few years that you know the exact day The War Within came out even if you didn't play or know anything about WoW. Cause on that day, about a month after DT released, ff14 was a complete ghost town, and the majority of those people never logged back in",

Something Blizzard just never supported in WoW till now.\n\nI think this is only not the case if the upcoming expansion is extremely good and uses Dawntrail as a bedrock because if its another dud its going to be a mess and i just do not want that. I want them both to thrive, Shadowlands is strangely the best selling WoW expansion but also the spiral out of stubborness until the very very last patch where they did what people finally wanted. Dawntrail very much has them sticking to their guns so far.",

Being a goober will always be possible, but most want their character to look cool. My main gripe with FF has always been that they have ignored so many small things over the years from old content to housing to glam that when Dawntrail turned out to be rather dissapointing nothing could distract from the dissatisfation that had built up. I hope they go a good direction and actually try to fix things, because excuses like spaghetti code can only get you so far before people are wondering if you even made a sincere effort.",

And this is why I think DT is closer to Shadowlands than BFA, just for diffrent reasons, but i think there is an even better expac to compare Dawntrail to - Cataclysm. \nOne thing i disagree with a lot of DT critics is that the issues started in DT. Far from it. Job design was consistent point of criticism basically since Summoner rework(Shb), so was lack of engaging content(starting with Bozja in Shb having weaker reception compared to Eureka as \"easier\" and \"more dull\" counterpart), semi-hc content also getting progressively easier(ie Extremes in EW) and the story started to weaken even in 13th shard saga(EW patch story). Oh, and also horrible netcode and tech debt, even though dev team claims there is no 1.0 residue left, even if we are pretty aware this is likely not true(showcased as recent as EW release queuing issues and constant vulnerability to ddos attacks and random routing switchups that are STILL present in the game and have been since ARR or lack of ability from the team to modernize Glamour system because of how they store item references in databases). It's just that MSQ still was the one big shield dev team could hide all of the issues behind and use to maintain good chunk of playerbase.  Once that was gone the flaws were in the spotlight and also content cadence changed giving players more times to brew with their thoughs, this is where a lot of people opted to grab pitchforks as they are obviously not happy with state of the game but too engaged in it to spend that energy somewhere else.\nAnd we saw that in WoW already too - WotLK is generally beloved expansion, but it does have some decisions, that in hindsight contributed to design that players now question like group finder. It's just that the quality of experience we got greatly overshadowed those small grievances at the time. However, in Cataclysm Blizzard opted to go with even more 'risky' QoL and progression choices, and since expectations after Wrath were sky high and some things weren't received as well suddenly players have started feeling more impacted by those changes, but with story/content being less engaging they attributed those issues to specifically Cataclysm, even if in some cases that direction was simply continuation from previous expansions.\nDo I think DT is death of the game? No. I personally unsubbed, I simply don't resonate with current story and ambience(I still think FF14 has superb fight design though, especially savage and above) but the game is far from bad still, especially for people who still have a lot of catching up in legacy/current content to do. However I do feel like current approach to design is flawed, the formula is safe and stale, the seem to be lack of trust in players to be able to digest complex ideas both in story and mechanics(kind of reminds me when Square attempted to dumb down FF for westerners with Mystic Quest, that one also wasnt received well btw) and the shielding that some content creators are doing towards the game will not help, will just hinder the experience even more.\nWe need to keep the pressure on the devs if we want the game(and through competition, the genre) to flourish, we just need to do it in responsible fashion.",

The raids are fantastic, the story refocused hard to put the player back in the spotlight, and even Wuk Lamat has been at least semi-permanently removed from the story, taking an injury that has left her barely able to walk unassisted for the foreseeable future, and said injury even came from a far lesser enemy than the final boss of the expansion she survived previously. And her fate is obviously to be what all other lead NPCs of the expansions and even the base game have been: Occasional cameos with little to no major plot relevance past their initial story. No, they're not going to kill her off, because they didn't kill Aymeric either, and he took a far worse injury in the post-Heavensward story.\n\nAnd we already know the little post-game story in the patches is done as well, with the next patch to start the prologue for the next expansion, with already confirmed FF14's old reliable villains, the Ascians, are going to be back.\n\ntl;dr version: Dawntrail is FF14's worst expansion, but it's still a hell of a lot better than a lot of other crap studios are churning out right now.",

Dawntrail's mediocre story isn't the reason people are losing interest, it simply failed to cover up how little engagement the current class gameplay requires. Stormblood started this design philosophy where it felt like the developers were saying: \"you're going to play the way we want you to play or we will ensure you'll have less fun.\" And Shadowbringers basically cemented it.\n\nWoW and FFXIV had to answer the same question: \"what do we do when 80% of our playerbase sucks at playing the game?\" \n\nBlizzard added the rotation helper and one button rotation as an optional feature. If you don't feel like learning, just use those tools and you'll do fine in most content. If you want to actually play your class and enjoy the intricacies, you can play normally. Also there's plenty of variety in specs which allows you to pick the level of engagement.\n\nMeanwhile, Square-Enix simplified all class gameplay to the point where it might as well be a one-button rotation. Blizzard is also trying to streamline some jank from class gameplay in Midnight but so far they're actually selective about what counts as jank. To put it in comparison, Square-Enix removed any type of maintainable DoT, Random Proc, building / maintaining aggro or other unique mechanic from Stormblood all the way to Dawntrail, not because it counts as \"jank\", but because it can be \"failed\" by players. We're now at the point where classes that do still have a DoT like Gunbreaker can only use it after popping their damage buff to guarantee the snapshot.\n\nIs it Shadowlands levels of bad? No, because they're not actively trying to go against what players want from the game. But they've been doubling down on a \"lowest common denominator\" game design philosophy that has been pushing a lot players away to go find something where the gameplay is actually engaging now that the story is no longer enough to serve as a motivator. And those players are spoiled for choice these days. \n\nI skip the story in WoW and enjoy the game just fine because the gameplay is stellar and engaging with a lot of variety. Content like Delves aren't hard but it's just fun to throw your class against them because the gameplay is fun as-is. Meanwhile i cannot see myself going through the same dungeon hallway layout again for an entire FFXIV expansion pack where I'm pressing 1-2-3 over and over and pop one ability ever minute or so.",

It's been a little while now since I booted up FFXIV, but last time I did custom \"builds\" and stuff still really weren't a thing. There was one clear path for BiS gear, and a rotation to learn, and that was kinda it. They need to shake that shit up. Introduce specializations. Make gear more interesting. I get that the homogeneity makes for tighter tuning in fights, but I'd take some looseness there if it meant more joy from experimenting in how you fundamentally play the game.\n\nI also feel like S-E really just need to invest more resources and people into FFXIV overall. More unique cutscenes with custom rigged animations instead of cycling through emotes. More voice acting. More unique music. If you're competing for the crown, then act like it Squre-Enix.",

                    "textDisplay": "If your premise is that DT has not been an absolute disaster for FFXIV, then I respectfully disagree. Not only is its MSQ terribly boring but the vast majority if not the totality of its new characters are at best boring and at worst utterly obnoxious stereotypes. So far even the XI collab is feeling lazily written with a poor story and nothing but base level fanservice. Meanwhile the tournament arc of the normal raids is barely interesting and has already been done much better by Omega. Really the only content I can maintain any interest in is what's *not* directly related to Tural: Occult Crescent has ARR lore, Cosmic Exploration keeps us in touch with the adorable Loporrits, and Pilgrim's Traverse lets us revisit the First as well as gives us more fae lore. For all that people, yourself included, want to claim that DT is at least better than SB, you could not even begin to compare the two. SB had an energy to it, good content, and great lore on all sides. DT meanwhile had characters that were not the least bit engaging on both sides.\n\nI'm of the opinion that the Endless will be XIV's downfall if they keep exploring the concept. We need to move on from it to better areas and storylines: Corvos, Meracydia, Aerslaent, the Thirteenth, and any other areas mentioned by the minor Scions if you spoke to them before finishing the last 6.0 quest. This game has too much going for it to be bogged down by one bad expansion but we need to leave Tural behind for good.\n\nYou don't need to be outraged in order to acknowledge the massive drop in quality of pretty much all main DT content, in particular the MSQ. You certainly don't need other people to tell you how to feel or what to say about it either. But let's be real here: just because DT isn't as bad as your Shadowlands does not make it any less of a disaster for XIV. I agree with you that we will move on and recover from this, but that won't make DT any better in retrospect.",
                    "textOriginal": "If your premise is that DT has not been an absolute disaster for FFXIV, then I respectfully disagree. Not only is its MSQ terribly boring but the vast majority if not the totality of its new characters are at best boring and at worst utterly obnoxious stereotypes. So far even the XI collab is feeling lazily written with a poor story and nothing but base level fanservice. Meanwhile the tournament arc of the normal raids is barely interesting and has already been done much better by Omega. Really the only content I can maintain any interest in is what's *not* directly related to Tural: Occult Crescent has ARR lore, Cosmic Exploration keeps us in touch with the adorable Loporrits, and Pilgrim's Traverse lets us revisit the First as well as gives us more fae lore. For all that people, yourself included, want to claim that DT is at least better than SB, you could not even begin to compare the two. SB had an energy to it, good content, and great lore on all sides. DT meanwhile had characters that were not the least bit engaging on both sides.\n\nI'm of the opinion that the Endless will be XIV's downfall if they keep exploring the concept. We need to move on from it to better areas and storylines: Corvos, Meracydia, Aerslaent, the Thirteenth, and any other areas mentioned by the minor Scions if you spoke to them before finishing the last 6.0 quest. This game has too much going for it to be bogged down by one bad expansion but we need to leave Tural behind for good.\n\nYou don't need to be outraged in order to acknowledge the massive drop in quality of pretty much all main DT content, in particular the MSQ. You certainly don't need other people to tell you how to feel or what to say about it either. But let's be real here: just because DT isn't as bad as your Shadowlands does not make it any less of a disaster for XIV. I agree with you that we will move on and recover from this, but that won't make DT any better in retrospect.",

WoW is basically dead to me, i'll give FF14 another shot if I start to notice the writing gets great again.",

Still, it didn’t magically undo the love I have for the game from the moments that made me cry in Shadowbringers, or the moments that made me smile through tears in Endwalker. Those are still very special to me. DT takes places on a new continent and it being boring doesn’t really ruin anything for me. I like the cultures, because the cultures weren’t the story.

I hated them *so* much that my love of Night Elves, of the lore of Warcraft, was *broken*. I don’t care how much content they’re putting out, I don’t want to be in Azeroth anymore. I’m not interested in being there. I don’t care about its races any longer. And all of that because that trifecta of expansions severed my connection. So, I gotta agree. I really don’t think it’s the same. I’m sure some people will come along and swear DT ate their cat or something but I’m talking about 3 expansions here. That’s like 8 years man. For 8 years I’ve been completely over the WoW storyline as a direct result of its expansions continuing that storyline. I was an Anduin fan because I loved him in the novels, and Shadowlands punished me for that every chance it got.

I've seen many content creators who have spoken about FFXIV giving legitimate criticisms get harassed because they weren't \"harsh\" enough.\n\nThe reality of it all is that Despite its setbacks, Dawntrail, similar to BFA, its still a good expansion with many welcomed changes and tremendous QoL improvements. \nBut Like you said the devs are taking up some of these issues and pushing forward to further improve the game. They have time and time again proven that if the game is going into a direction that people aren't having fun with, they will do what is needed to fix the problems. I believe if continue  they focus to improve and fix years old issues and add even more content that is unique, like deep dungeon, that the game will continue to flourish. We still have one big patch before the expansion, thats 7.5 and I would not be surprised if they made housing changes that matches that of WoW, plus the addition of Beast Master in 7.5. \n\nI think both games need each other to continue to succeed and tribalism is bullshit.",

I like constructive videos like these.\nNGL I was also let down by Dawntrail but more than the expansion being a problem itself, it's more it started to show some of the limits of the approach of the devs. Without a great story, some aspects of the game loop felt more annoying to go through.\nBut I would say it's far from turning FF14 to bad. The main concern is more like we fear that the devs may be stuck in a formula that could lead to lack of excitement in the future.

I like constructive videos like these.\nNGL I was also let down by Dawntrail but more than the expansion being a problem itself, it's more it started to show some of the limits of the approach of the devs. Without a great story, some aspects of the game loop felt more annoying to go through.\nBut I would say it's far from turning FF14 to bad. The main concern is more like we fear that the devs may be stuck in a formula that could lead to lack of excitement in the future. That's why I think now it's good time to call them out but in a constructive way.\nDoomposting on the other hand is everything except constructive criticism.",

I'm not talking about MSQ at all, there are many more issues with the game that have compounded over the years that they've ignored which has put them in a tough spot once that veil was lifted from the eyes of the playerbase recently. I see the title has changed, but if I had to make a comparison to a WoW expansion, this would be like Warlords of Draenor - the \"raid or die\" expansion. It's not really as bad as that because an FF14 expansion has 5 major patches in an expansion after the launch patch, so there will be more content than WoD regardless which had 1 patch (not counting 6.1). But it's the same kind of deal, if you're a veteran casual player who is playing patch-by-patch, there's barely anything to do. If you're a hardcore player, the devs have given you a massive amount of very difficult raid fights to do. Which is nonsensical in the first place since the hardcore crowd is around 10% or so of the playerbase. This game is not in a good state, the latest player numbers have dropped substantially, and they've ended up putting a lot of pressure on themselves for 8.0 by putting aside issues like the homogenized job design that we've had since Shadowbringers for years, while not delivering on the content side for the majority of the playerbase either, and letting issues like spaghetti code, the repetitive formula, longer patches with no real repeatable content and lack of innovation fester over the years as well.\n\nThere is a big frustration in the playerbase these days from the developers ignoring feedback for years. You know the glamour unlock that you were praising in the video? Yoshi-P said multiple times before, even as recent as this expansion that he didn't want to unlock any glamour restrictions because he didn't like the idea of Black Mage wearing tank armor. They finally budged on it when they kept losing subscriptions. 10 Years to add chat bubbles and other basic addons is not something to praise either. A lot of feedback these days ends up becoming uncivil because of the frustration of the developers not listening. Sure, we get live letters, but they don't ever talk to us like they're actually listening anymore. What did Yoshi-P say about the Forked Tower issue? It was due to cost that we didn't get a normal mode. That is not due to cost, it's bad decision making to make a harder version only in an expansion that was already devoid of casual content by then. What have the developers said about job homogenization and over-simplification since Shadowbringers? Nothing - too bad if you want classes with more depth than just dealing raw damage. Instead, they doubled down on it in Endwalker, and then again in Dawntrail, while Yoshi-P tells everyone to wait until 8.0, which was 2.5-3 years away at that point, for more meaningful job changes that aren't just \"Deals potency to enemy\". The Q&A they did in the 7.2 live letter was refreshing actually because they really don't ever talk to the playerbase about their questions and concerns, I wish they'd keep doing that or send surveys, something to be more in touch with the game and playerbase who want to play the game but have lost reasons to play.\n\nCBU3 has grown complacent in recent years from the success of Shadowbringers and the drowning out of constructive criticisms from the community, and I hope they can make big improvements to the game in 8.0. They know something is wrong, because Yoshida himself said they want to do some sort of \"rebirth\", and SQEX's Kiryu was even told directly by a shareholder about the decline in quality and players in Dawntrail, to which he responded that he was aware of it. I see some comments on this video of people being very defensive of the game, which the FF14 community is kind of notorious for, and that doesn't help anything. Players like that who want to drown out all negative feedback and criticisms are hurting the game more than anyone. It's important to give constructive feedback where it's due, and FF14 has a lot that it has to work on - the dwindling sub numbers and higher levels of negativity everywhere you look are proof of that.",

The community at large hates wuk lamat, I actually lile her. So yeah dawntrails msq was a long tedium, but the msq in 14, is always a long tedium of endless exposition about nonsense. If it were up to me the msq would be more dungeons and trials, less yapping. But I loved the normal\\Savage raids, I liked some of the dungeons, I enjoyed occult cresecent for the first week until I did everything, been enjoying deep dungeon, I loved chaotic raid, treasure maps, trials, alliance raids. Like the game part of dawntrail to me is great, which is what I care about. If it were up to me like Id be cool if the msq was removed entirely from the game so I could just play the fun parts of the game. But for people who love the story many of them see the dawntrail msq as a big letdown.

You can say many things about BFA, it surely was not the best expansion, but I don't believe it should be regarded as equal to Dawntrail for XIV. When I logged in during BFA, I never felt like I had literally NOTHING to do. Even between patches, there was always something to do. The player count was on a stable decline, at least until Classic WoW launched and fragmented the playerbase. There was SOMETHING to do, there were people to do that \"something\" with.\n\nI believe it was completely missed a major factor in why people are leaving FFXIV behind. Both the Length of time between patches, and the amount of content, and in a lot of cases quality of content in patches is absolutely abysmal. Honestly why should any of us stay subscribed to the game after playing the patch and doing literally all of the new content that matters in one week? There is literally 5 months of NOTHING between patches and it is culling off the playerbase like you could never imagine. The story can be bad, but if the majority of people are standing around with nothing they care to do, good luck patching together a broken community. One other thing I should add is that XIV had the chance to LEARN from WoW, and Blizzards failure. Blizzard was arrogant, they ignored the advice and feedback of their playerbase. Yoshida and his team have fallen into exactly the same trap of ignoring community feedback. This is why jobs have all become mindless despite protests (especially from healers) going on since Shadowbringers, to which he directly told them to \"Go play Ultimate\". I would not assign brownie points to FFXIV for adding basic quality of life features that had to be modded into the game because they didn't want to spend a trivial amount of their budget incorporating them into the game. (Chat bubbles takes 10 years to add to the game? How about gizmo's to place furnishing in our houses better? The UI is literally so bad it contributed to the creation of DISCORD.)\n\nThe amount of player loss, and reputational damage to the game is on par with Shadowbringers, I hate to say it. The community, (Or former community at this point.) is not going to come back. Dawntrail is a permanent smear on the games legacy and reputation.",

The first part of the MSQ is boring, but towards the end of the X.0 it starts to pick up, and then the .X patches are pretty solid. Stormblood was followed up with Shadowbringers, probably the best Expansion in FFXIV currently. Honestly Dawntrail was always doomed to a lot of unfair criticism. Coming from the heights of Shadowbringers and Endwalker, a transitory Expansion like Dawntrail had no hopes of living up to that. While I don't think whatever is next will be Shadowbringers levels of hype, something on the levels of Heavensward is more than possible. It takes time to build the sort of story we all enjoy.",

I wouldnt say so, it is just somewhat better.\n\nAlso FFXIV open world content is great ? thats a joke :D FFXIV's open world is just an afterthought, if they didnt need one to label themselves an mmorpg they wouldnt have one.

But when I get tired of WoW, I loathe it for a while. I think this comes from most of WoW's content being either far too easy and unrewarding, or requiring more commitment than I can spare.\n\nThere's nothing in WoW like FFXIV's Extreme Trials or even Normal Raids. WoW's raids (on an engaging difficulty, leaving out LFR) take several hours, and break up due to slightest problems. Then there's Mythic+, which is shorter form, but often has hostile players (caused by how punishing failure is) and no clear end goal. What I like to play is something that's over after I've beaten it. WoW's easier content like Delves is anything but, they're endless treadmills of drip fed rewards that eventually feel to me like psychological manipulation in an attempt to make you addicted.",

In Dawntrail I only played through main MSQ so far until the credits I haven't played any patch story yet but if I had to compare this to WoW's recent stories I'd say Dawntrail is much better than anything else WoW has put out in the past 5+ years. Yes sure Wuklamat is cringe as hell, but Bakul'jaja's backstory, and the whole Endless Storyline (the ghost city) made me cry several times. WoW's story made me cry last time in Legion when Ysera died and that side quest with Runas the Shamed.. that was what 8 years ago now? WoW's story feels too safe, it's all about family and coming and working together against a greater evil.. super boring and they don't take risks anymore.",

As someone who basically FLED WoW during Shadowlands for all the negativity in and around the game, it's been unnerving to see that same negativity start to creep in to 14 from the playerbase, and I'm glad I'm not the only one seeing it all and going 'okay, calm down, you guys are going overboard with it.'",

If one person messes up the whole raid wipes. It demands near perfect play from everyone at all times. They aren't particularly hard, but because how they've designed the player aspect of it they've made the raids insufferable. Not to mention many of the classes just are not fun anymore.

That, on top of the stagnant job design, means so many of those players that came in around 2020 have been playing the exact same game for 5 years, and they got better while it got easier.\n\nThe end result is a lot of players who can’t find the engagement they used to have because they’ve now mastered the simple jobs, and outgrown the difficulty of the casual content. Before, you could enjoy casual content as a good player because your job was engaging at a baseline. Now, when neither your class nor the content takes any attention anymore, do you really want to do your dailies? This has been the story of almost everyone I know that has quit or taken a break in the last few years.

I still can see myself playing again for the story and i will say i do like how in FF14 i can feel finished and do something else. It was alot easier for me to walk away from FF14 than it was for WoW.\n\n Anyways my main gripe with FF14 is the players more than the systems, to me the systems need some tweaking and improvements but the players is where its kind of rough. In my 4 years of playing FF14, I have dealt with soooo much drama than in my 15yrs of WoW. People say WoW's playerbase is toxic, thats mainly true if you just pug and even that all theyll do is talk shit to you in one moment and then youll never see that player again most likely. In Guilds 90% of the time everyone is on the same page and are pretty welcoming and helpful. FF14 on the other hand you join an FC and things go good for a little while until you rub someone the wrong way especially unintentionally. Say you and an FC mate are talking in discord and you mention something beliefs wise whether it be world views, political views, FF14 opinions, and someone whos not even part of the conversation sees or hears it that doesnt agree with those things, they now label you a very hateful person and everyone needs to know about it. However this person or persons have a problem with you for wrongthink and instead of being adults and talking to you about it for clarification or even just a simple \"hey i overheard you say x and it made me feel off, what did you mean?\" they start rumors about you or act like theyre your best friend while speaking hate about you behind your back to make everyone hate you too like we're in highschool still. \n\nIn the same breath there are alot of sad lonely ppl in FF14 who attatch themselves to other players mostly female players in roleplay settings and get very possessive of them and start drama over it to the point where they stalk players in game. Ive even seen FCs stalk players they kick or if an FC split happens they like to harass ppl on the other end of the split. Ive even see RP clubbing tear Fcs apart because if you dont RP or in my experience Mod the game, you are treated as if you dont exist. I tried clubbing and had alot of friends but as soon as i started raiding in 14 i lost all my friends because I didnt club anymore. I even lost a friend to modding, we used to play everyday and chill but as soon as they got into modding its like i didnt exist anymore because i didnt like modding and theyd rather play with other modders.\n\nThen finally the raiding community. The thing that got me about the raid community is statics dont stay together, everyone is more worried about their own progression than helping the team. We start off as a team but then some discover they are more skilled at raiding than others and are unwilling to help with progressing as a team and start going into PF to push their progress despite it gimping the main team if they clear before raid days. All the teams i was apart of you always had 2 or 3 players clearing at reset then screwing us over with loot because they got their kill already and or eventually just left the team or no showed because they can clear without the team. This is the reason i liked wows system better because ppl can help and not screw over the loot.",

Unless they can massively innovate on their core gameplay, content structure, gear system and reward structures in the next expansion... well, things aren't looking well right now. The latest census is showing a roughly 50% decline in active player numbers compared to the game's peak around 3 years ago and  with no signs of slowing down. They need to change things, and fast.

The thing FFXIV has going for it is it didn’t reinvent the wheel with each expansion, the core systems are consistent. When the story in something like DT shows up, it highlights the flaws existing in the systems already in place. That being said, those systems aren’t terrible, they need refinement, polish, and updating. Nothing in the consistent behavior for Creative Unit 3 suggests they’ve completely lost the plot, spreadsheet analyze use of systems, and show a disconnect with players.",

The first 'patch' we got was just a camera. We have a 14 month gap between the release of WoD and an actual patch with decent amounts of content. Let's not forget the at least two patches of things that was cut. The capitol cities that were cut. And the ending of WoD completely changing from what was told to us.

I understand it was problematic for balance but i still thought there was a lot of unique jobs in shadowbringers and endwalker still had a couple that i liked to play but dawntrail everything is so simple that i get no enjoyment replaying content.

If i can play one job i can play all of em fairly easily. I miss how unique they were in stormblood. I understand it was problematic for balance but i still thought there was a lot of unique jobs in shadowbringers and endwalker still had a couple that i liked to play but dawntrail everything is so simple that i get no enjoyment replaying content. I play to beat it once then quit when i used to really enjoy playing savage on every job",

(I was ok with disabling powerful combat addons like weakauras, but they crossed my line and also disbaled unit frame addons and made it impossible to alter the default UI - yeah I'm not supporting a company that pulls the rug out from under players while lying about it.)  Uninstalled the game, didn't preorder Midnight, never touching another Blizzard product.\n\nFF14 is still up in the air for me.  I gradually drifted away from the game after Endwalker (which was fantastic until the lackluster patch content).  If they improve FF14 again I'll consider playing it again (a Switch 2 version would make it more likely for me).",

A lot of people speak of Dawntrail's story as its defining low. It's not - it really isn't. The game would be good if the Story was its lowest point because, as bad as it is, it isn't THAT bad. A game is a game and a game is defined by all of it as a whole and for something like an MMO, that is meant to be a game you SUB to and play continuously, gameplay is king.\n\nHonestly, the review expresses my view on it in such length that I can't through youtube comments without upsetting people, but here's the most glaring excerpt IMO and it'll probably determine the MMOs future.\n\nContent cadence has become slower than EW, which had already slowed slightly from ShB to a point that is actually grueling. 6+ months for a 4-boss savage is laughable. At the very least, in this latest odd patch, they actually added something to stimy the time between savages with the new 4-man 'savage' fight. Not that it has good rewards, mind you, a recurring theme, really.\n\nCircling back to the point of gameplay. The 2-minute meta has become well estblished after its inception in ShB. With the repeated trimming of jobs, the uniformization of job gameplay and everything else, the reality of this game's gameplay has come to the forefront. As one of the two premiere tab-targetting MMOs, comparisons with WoW are abound and the truth of the matter is simple. If you want an interesting MMO with interesting combat that doesn't have too high of a skill floor, you need either trimmed down gameplay that's fast or complex/busy gameplay that's slow. XIV had the latter, but are moving towards the former. In this limbo state, the game presents itself as a game with slow gameplay and trimmed down jobs - in short, it presents itself as repetetitve and dull in its core gameplay loop with Jobs that are very samey and seldom have much to separate them bar job identity.",
