He's kinda just there to act as a foil to Kiryu, except when he was introduced as a villain, most of his scenes don't even show him doing villainous acts, we just hear about it after the fact for the most part. In contrast, Bryce has been not only more impactful as an antagonist, but also more effective on the plot. Not to mention Eiji is SIGNIFICANTLY better than both cause not only of the twist, but we also get to see ALL sides of him, from his \"good\" side to his evil side straight up, and he's been present FAR longer than either of them (only to be essentially forgotten by the plot until the ending cause they didn't know what else to do with him, but I digress).\n\nAs a result most of us are kinda just \"eh\" on Ebina. It almost feels like they took Eiji's character, took away part of the \"yakuza hatred\" element, and turned that into Ebina. I personally think Eiji should've just been the main antagonist altogether if he had Ebina's backstory. It would've made WAY more sense IMO",
