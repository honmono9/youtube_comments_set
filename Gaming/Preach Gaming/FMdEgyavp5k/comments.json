This is the worst playthrough I've seen both from Preach and of this game in general.  I'm not sure how this got so out of hand so quickly.  \n\nStuff like the dumb fart noise donations by SeriousSion early on and consistently throughout the game definitely set the tone for this to be an awful experience.  Combine it with the absolute refusal to engage with any story elements, fast skipping dialogue because it was during combat, and a complete lack of understanding for the gameplay elements to give himself any sort of advantage...  I'm frankly shocked that the new higher difficulty option allowed this type of gameplay to succeed in clearing the game, even worse that it was while under-leveled...  Like, several areas in this VoD alone, he has the option to hit a target, like a knight, from the side or from the front, and places himself to attack from the front.  There was no other tactical merit to it outside of just still not understanding that you have a higher success rate from the sides and even better from the back.  \n\nIt just felt like he wasn't in an RPG mindset for this one, and should've just played it later when he was in the mood.",

It's genuinely not overly difficult to understand and keep track of the story. Instead of using any of the resources available to clear things up, dialogue started getting skipped, you rush through or straight up ignore story beats (a voiced cutscene that specifically states that a civil war has begun, and minutes later during dialogue a character mentions the war and preach goes \"wait, there's a war?\"). \n\nThe shitty gags and visuals from chris are personally never funny and detract from the game being played, the fart sound effect ruining cutscenes which only further pushed mike out of it more than he already was.

You could have gone out, done some sped up auto battle leveling for 30, 40 minutes, gained a few levels to make that penultimate fight a more even fight (because story mission enemies have fixed levels) instead of the enemy team stomping you into the pavement, and made it BACK to that fight in well under five hours, and for some reason you refuse. That was hours of time wasted because you refused to even mildly adjust your mindset and simply grind a little bit.\n\nIf mike or anyone from the team ever sees this, I've stuck around for so long because the vast majority of the time I love it here, but holy shit...",
