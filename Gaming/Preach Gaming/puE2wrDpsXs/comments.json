I also had a different experience since I was a kid and though I didn’t play multiplayer Halo 2 scales difficulty for playing co-op even couch co-op. We also played on legendary and for some reason in halo 2 they decided a single player death should cause a reset to checkpoint rather than requiring both players to die. So the game felt plenty long to me 😂. I didn’t care about the boss fight being short because at the time I felt most boss fights in current fps games felt contrived and janky. So I was glad it was over quickly. (Well quickly ish I remember Johnson taking far longer between sniper shots). \n\nI think you might really enjoy ODST. It’s one of the best games in the franchise in my opinion. Even though it is a very different format and mood. Even if you don’t get to it on stream, I would be interested in your thoughts. \n\nThere’s also the audio drama promo which is really good. But very few people have listened to it. Many didn’t even play along. I think I threw my official dvd of it out once ripping it which is disappointing because it now sells for like $1K😅",
