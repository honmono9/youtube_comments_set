Lines were sharp and packed punch. The English version had the downside of muddling some of the plot concepts with translation mistakes, but the dialogue itself was for the most part vastly more effective and human.\n\nThis translation drained the life out of it. It's an attempt to do a similar kind of translation as the third game set in Ivalice, Vagrant Story - which is a high bar for language and writing - but that script was translated and written by an absolute master, Alexander O. Smith. This is a pale imitation of his style marred by hack sensibilities, often converting simple statements into a line ten times the word count as the original text, employing lazy proverbs and dressing each line up in needless fluff.\n\nWhile it has a few good moments, it's a massive diminishment of the story of Final Fantasy Tactics - this is coming from an enthusiast for opera, theater, and 19th century novels. I'm the target audience for this, and I consider it a huge failure.\n\nIt still blows my mind that this guy endured several thousand times the amount of this same kind of stuff throughout Final Fantasy 14, and then couldn't even feign basic respect for a much better story translated in the same style",
