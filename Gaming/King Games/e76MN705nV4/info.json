Master real‑world road rules in bite‑size lessons, pass your driving test, then take on taxi, delivery, and bus routes across living cities and motorways.\n\nVirtual Driving Simulator School 3D\nStop wasting paid lesson time on the basics. Virtual Driving School is a serious, skills-first simulator that teaches real-world manoeuvres and traffic systems, so you show up to your first lesson already road-ready. Drill fundamentals in quick 1–3 minute scenarios, then take 30–40 minute exam-style drives with detailed scoring (major/minor faults), and repeat until it sticks. Then test your skills on city streets, rural roads, and motorways, in sun, snow, rain, or ice.\n\nReal Cars Multi-Storey Driver\nTargeted lessons cover the fundamentals in short bursts (1–3 mins): Gears, clutch control, moving off, lane choice, merges, roundabouts, parking, emergency stops, and more.\n\nExam‑style test routes test your driving comprehension (30–40 mins): Dynamic hazards, varied directions, and major/minor fault breakdowns, just like a real assessment.\nRealistic traffic & signage: Pedestrians, buses, cyclists, temporary roadworks, box junctions, crossings, level crossings, lane control, motorway incidents, different times of day.\nHazard Avoidance: Train for the unexpected — cars pulling out from behind lorries, reckless overtakes, sudden stops, dangerous drivers, and more.\n\nGame Modes\nTutorials & Lessons – Short, focused drills in safe areas and live roads. Earn check marks as you master each topic.\nTests & Licences – 30–40 minute assessed drives with hazards and route variations. Pass to unlock Taxi, Delivery, and Bus.\nGuided Drives – Curated 5–10 minute routes combining multiple hazards, road types and conditions.\nFree Drive – Explore and practice at your pace across cities, rural roads, and motorways.\nTaxi Mode – Earn tips for smooth, rule‑compliant driving; buy new vehicles. (Licence required.)\nDelivery Mode – Vans and HGVs with realistic weight and braking. (Licence required.)\nBus Routes – Hit every stop on time without compromising safety. (Licence required.)\n\nOver 70 lessons covering all aspects of driving broken down into several categories. \nBasics: Setup, controls, gears, moving off, turning, reversing, pull up left/right, blind bends, hill starts.\nLane Selection: Correct lane choice, merges L/R, zipper merges, segregated turns, slip roads, small‑to‑large roundabouts.\nTraffic Systems: Traffic lights & filters, zebra/controlled crossings, bus lanes & stops, box junctions, level crossings, diversions/roadworks, one‑way & narrow roads, unmarked junctions, priority rules.\nSpeed, Stopping & Parking: 20 mph zones, speed bumps, dual carriageways, national limits, police “SLOW”; stop/give way, emergency stop; car parks, parallel (fwd/rev), multi‑storey.\n\nMotorways & Advanced: On/off slips, lane control, chevrons, countdown markers, services, jams; towing, trams, signals out, village gateways, stopping distances, uncontrolled crossings.\nWorld & handling\nHD environments with pedestrians and dense traffic with realistic driving AI.\nLocations: Launch regions include Conway, CairnLoch, and a new urban area, with locations from around the world rolling out (UK, US, Europe, Asia).\nDynamic conditions: Day/night, rain/snow, wet/icy grip that changes stopping distances.\nVehicle variety: From compact cars and family sedans to vans, HGVs, and buses. Each with distinct visibility, weight, and braking feel.\nFun Game Elements\nDrive everything from quirky 3-wheelers to massive trucks.\nUnlock achievements, collectables, and new cars as you progress.\nAccessible and engaging for players aged 8 to 88.\n\nDesigned to shortcut paid lessons – responsibly\nVDS is built to frontload your learning: master core skills, understand road language, and sharpen hazard perception before you meet an instructor. That means fewer paid hours on fundamentals, more on passing the test.\n\nDisclaimer: Virtual Driving School is a training‑oriented simulation and a powerful supplement to real‑world instruction. It does not replace certified driver training. Always follow local laws and licensing requirements.\n\nComing Content Packs\n• Learn to Drive an HGV: Master heavy goods vehicle handling and regulations.\n• Asia Driving Pack: Explore detailed new locations and region-specific road rules.\n• Classic Car Pack: Experience cars from the 1950s onwards with authentic handling.\n• Local Area Driving: Drive where you live with customisable regional road packs.",
