Have you ever seen a piece of toast rob a bank?!\n\nWelcome back!! Have you seen the time? It's G for Gaming o' clock! We're bringing you all a really classic type episode of some super fun Roblox shenanigans today! We have the whole family here (even Enzo... kinda). That's right, under the orders of Mr. Sunflower, Adley, Niko, Navey, Mom, Dad and Enzo booked their tickets back to the familiar Roblox town of Brookhaven to do some dastardly crimes! First off, we needed to make a lot of money so we knew that we needed to break into the secret part of the bank and steal as much money as we could! Adley guided us through the crazy maze like basement of the bank to steal diamonds, money and bitcoin?! Whatever we got away with, we made tons! Adley drove the girls getaway vehicle with Navey and Mom while Niko drove the boys getaway vehicle with Dad and Enzo! Since we had just robbed the bank, we had more than enough money to buy ourselves a new secret base to hide in! Adley got us this super cool secret garage base that had a secret underground bunker with a vault, a jail and a bunch of cameras that we could see all of Brookhaven with! After that, we did a couple more little robberies on the unsuspecting people of Brookhaven! Then we decided to celebrate with some good old hamburgers! But then, Adley decided we should rob the place and it all went crazy and out of control from there!\n\nThanks for Watching!! BYE!
