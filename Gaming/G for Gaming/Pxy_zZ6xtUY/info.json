Welcome back everybody to another awesome & fun episode of G for Gaming! Today we've Adley, Navey & Niko to all play this cute, adorable, Roblox pet adoption story game with Dad! We always love the idea of adopting cute puppies so we decided to BECOME cute little pups!\n\nWe all transported to the same Roblox game! This adorable little Roblox adopt game is called Pet Story! Adley & Niko had matching fur for their dogs and Navey had the most cute little dog as hers! Dad was the toughest and coolest pup of course! At first we started at the Pet Adoption Center and were hanging out with all the other pets and animals at the animal shelter! The owner was telling us all about the other animals and which ones were nice and which ones were mean and scary! Then we had to go to bed for the night and a bunch of creepy cockroaches started invading the place and we had to fight them all off! Then we saw a bird out the window and... well, you know! We are dogs and we have to chase birds! But after that we were lost outside and eventually made our way to a zoo where we had to help a bunch of animals in danger! The hyenas had broken out and we had to save some cute little turtles that celebrated with a dance party when we got them! Then we eventually went to the aquarium at the zoo where Sr. Squidy was flooding the whole place! We had to get to him and calm him down before he caused to much chaos! After we battled three huge sharks, we were able to finally get to Sr. Squidy and talk to him! But he was beyond angry! He thought that we stole all his ink, but we didn't and then he started attacking him so we had to have another battle! He was tough to fight and was going crazy but eventually we got him and we told him that it wasn't us, it was secretly another evil villain who had taken the ink! Sr. Squidy apologized and fixed the aquarium! Maybe in the sequel, we will finally figure out who was really behind all of this!\n\nThanks for watching!! BYE!
