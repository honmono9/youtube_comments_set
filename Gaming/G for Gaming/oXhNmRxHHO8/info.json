Welcome back one and all, boys and girls, ladies and gentlemen to another brand new incredible episode of your favorite YouTube gaming channel, G for Gaming! Today we have an extra special video for you! As most of you know, Valentine's day just happened and when that happens, lots of our favorite games get updates and new content for holidays! So Adley and Dad are checking out the brand new Dress to Impress Valentine's Update on Roblox! Adley was SO excited to get into it and check out all of the new things because obviously, Valentine's day is a BIG deal for Dress to Impress. Adley joined in and started seeing all of the new stuff! There was a knew hub/salon to get ready in that's decorated in all sorts of cute pink colors, hearts and even giant candy hearts! Shaun was reading all of the things that were added and found out that there was new codes in Dress to Impress! Adley had to check it out and the first code that we found gave you a super cute cloud that your model can ride around on! How cute!! All of the themes were super cute too and we even got to do the 'Fast Food Mascot' again like we did in one of our previous Dress to Impress episodes! In that episode Dad dressed up as Ronald McDonald and Adley dressed up as Wendy! This time Adley dressed up as Wendy again but Shaun decided to be Colonel Sanders from KFC! Later we even added our own custom Dress to Impress theme that was special for Valentines Day! Adley wanted the theme to be 'Valentine's Crush' but the game wouldn't let us so we had to settle on just 'Valentine's.\" Dad just kept winning almost every round even when Adley thought that she was for sure going to win but maybe because DAD kept forgetting to give her FIVE STARS!!\n\nWe had a BLAST checking out the new Dress to Impress update for Valentine's Day! We always love hanging out and gaming on Roblox with whatever fun and cool games we find! What cool updates could be coming next for Dress to Impress?\n\nThanks for Watching!! BYE!
