Today we have another super fun Roblox RP video for you all! In this video, we got Navey to try and teach Dad and Saedie how they need to act in order to be Royal Babies! Maybe it didn't all go exactly as planned, but the crazy adventures and journey we all went on was so much fun! We decided to play on Roblox Livetopia, Navey was our mom and Shaun and Saedie were the babies that she had to take care of! We pretended that it was the babies' birthdays at first so Navey was making them cake and getting their presents ready! But Dad and Saedie were being sneaky spy babies and trying to find out what Navey was planning! But Navey caught them and they had to go to bed! But, the next craziest thing was that now it was NAVEY'S birthday so Dad and Saedie had to get ready for Mom's birthday instead! They got a cake and presents... well, their pet turkey actually went to go and pick up the presents for them, how nice! Then we went to our Grandma's castle where our Royalty comes from! We were exploring and trying to find Grandma but we don't think she was home today! We think Navey learned a lot today trying to take care of the two crazy babies, even though they didn't learn a lot about being royal, we still had a ton of fun today!!\n\nThanks for watching!! BYE!
