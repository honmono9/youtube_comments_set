We're super excited to jump back into more Dress to Impress on Roblox now that they have just dropped their brand new update & event for the summer time! There are so many cool new things for us to check out and we checked out a LOT of the cool new stuff! We started off with Adley and Dad jumping on for the VERY first time to see what all of these new things were! We teleported to the same game on Roblox and Adley was HYPED!! We started reading off all the new changes and they sounded so cool! There are all sorts of new codes, clothes, they brought back the old lobby and runways too! We even saw a spooky hidden Lana that was hiding on the runway just... watching us! Creepy!! We even got special help from another one of our best Dress to Impress players, Navey! Navey came downstairs and joined us for a few super fun rounds!\n\nThen, the best part was a new round called a \"Special Round!\" where you get a secret super cool theme! This time for this update it was... DRUMROLL PLEASE!!... MERMAiDS! That's right! We just dropped our Mermaid Birthday Party animation on Spacestation Animation and it was almost like Dress to Impress was helping us celebrate by making the theme mermaids! It was awesome!! The whole runway goes under the sea and everyone has mermaid tails to try and design the cutest and most beautiful mermaid you can! Guess what the best part was... Adley got on the podium in the special round and won a bunch of super cool clothes and accessories from it all! This update is AWESOME!\n\nThanks for Watching!! BYE!
