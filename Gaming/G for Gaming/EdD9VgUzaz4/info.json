We promised we'd be back with a part 2 of our Halloween Roblox special and here we are! Welcome back to another extra scary episode of G for Gaming! Today Adley, Niko, Navey and Dad plus some friends and cousins! First up, we tried out this spooky, trick or treating Roblox story game! It seemed normal at first, we were just going from house to house getting candy and doing the normal Halloween things UNTIL we got to the last house and the EViL PUMPKiN KiNG was inside with a trap for us! To win, we all had to get through a bunch of challenges and obbys so we could save Halloween! At the very end, Niko finally found the golden piece of candy and won the whole game for us! After that we played a school game with a spooky twist! We had to run around the school finding money and things so that we could fight against the bullies and... the spooky mascot! We didn't get too far but we tried out best! We had such a blast playing these scary Roblox games for Halloween!\n\nHappy Halloween!\n\nThanks for Watching!! BYE!
