Welcome to a brand-new episode of G for Gaming! Today we start with Adley and Navey playing family in Brookhaven—Navey is the baby, Adley is the mom… but then Dad comes downstairs! They get caught playing Roblox past their bedtime, but instead of sending them to bed, Dad joins in and they all start a new family together. Navey decides they should be an elf family that leaves presents in people’s houses and sits on shelves—it’s so funny! Next, they jump into a game where they turn into a deer family that has to survive without being caught by lions, and Adley even finds a super cute baby hippo. After that, it’s time for the crazy tsunami game where giant waves crash down and everyone tries to survive, which totally reminded them of their trip to Hawaii! Finally, they wrap things up with a bunch of fun Roblox mini-games you won’t want to miss. Hope you enjoy the video! 🚀✨\n\n\nenjoy some A for Adley videos: https://www.youtube.com/c/AforAdleyLe...\nhave a blast with our A for Adley Shorts: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMHpfyAqrjrhn-mRS2bUL0g\nshare a best day ever with our family: https://www.youtube.com/user/Shonduras\nfun best day ever shorts: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgVE...\n\nwatch the latest A for Adley video: ADLEY and NiKO are in a HOTWHEELS SHOW!!\nCrazy Track Creator Showdown Challenges & Fun with Friends\nhttps://youtu.be/bNy5eS5n7yo?feature=shared\n\n\nthis is our channel G for Gaming!! this is a place that i can share all of my favorite gaming moments!!",
