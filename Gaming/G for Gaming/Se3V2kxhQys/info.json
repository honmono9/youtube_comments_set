We are back with PART 2 of our 99 Nights Cave update with the family! Last time we got to do some awesome things that we've never been able to do before! Last time we got to actually help the deer and later on he came back to help us fight off the cultists! But this time the full cave update was out and we were ready to explore and find all of the secrets of the cave and the bat! So, Welcome back to G for Gaming! We've got the whole fam with us, Mom & Dad, Adley, Niko, Navey and even Enzo is here to help us find all the craziest things that this update has hiding inside! We had to search the map to find the entrance to this crazy cave and make sure we had enough tools and food to try and fight all of the wild things inside! Inside the cave we found murals of the deer, the bat and even the cultists! But, what does it mean?! It's all so mysterious. Deeper inside the cave we found these giant statues of the monsters, but if we activated them, we got extra buffs! Shaun activated the one that made it so our hunger goes down slower so we don't need as much food! There were also hundreds of cultists inside that we had to fight off! We eventually blew up a bunch of rocks and found the exit to the cave! But the next time we ventured into the cave, things might not have gone as smoothly...\n\nThanks for Watching!! BYE!
