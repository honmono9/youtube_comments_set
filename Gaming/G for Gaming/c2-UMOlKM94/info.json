Hey friends and welcome BACK to your favorite gaming YouTube channel, G for Gaming! We're back of course with another super fun video in one of our favorite games of all time, Roblox!\n\nToday we got Adley, Navey and Dad together to try out a new update in one of our all time favorite Roblox games! You know what that games is? That's right! We're back with another Roblox Dress to Impress video and this time with an extra exciting update! Part of the Dress to Impress Valentine's video was a brand new gamemode that you can play! The new game mode is called Dress to Impress Style Showdown! We didn't know exactly how it worked quite yet but we'd figure it out pretty quickly as we tried it out together! Style Showdown is super similar to normal Dress to Impress, we get a theme BUT we get either less or more time than usual depending on what round it is! Once you get the theme, you've got to do your absolute best outfit and hope that people give you a star! Instead of rating each person, you only get to give out a certain number of stars at the end of each fashion show! Then, whoever gets the least amount of stars gets on the chopping block and possibly ELIMINATED! We had so many fun rounds and Shaun almost got eliminated BUT he found an immunity statue that makes it so he can't be eliminated if he gets put on the chopping block! So luckily dad was safe! But then later we found a Dress to Impress glitch and we all got stuck in between rounds just looking at the runway with no Lana! Once it unglitched, we got back in the game and everyone was GONE! But, that was good news for us because that meant that all of us won! Adley got first place, Navey got second place and Shaun got third place! The new game mode in Roblox Dress to Impress was SO fun! We will have to play more of it soon!\n\nHave you tried the new Dress to Impress game mode yet?\n\nThanks for watching!! BYE!
