We've got to find the zombie cure ASAP!!\n\nWelcome back everybody to a brand new, shiny and exciting episode of G for Gaming! Today we are super excited to share this new game that we found on Roblox, it's a bit spooky, it's a bit goofy and it's all the way FUN! Today we got Adley, Niko and Dad together to climb on board the Zombie Train! This new game we found is called Roblox Dead Rails and it's super fun! In this new roblox game, we have to drive our own train through the desert to try and find a zombie virus cure! The whole time we have to avoid getting oofed by the bandits and the zombies and even... Werewolves? Dracula Dad even made an appearance one night when there was a full moon, but he wasn't too much of a bother and he went away pretty quickly! But, the train runs out of fuel super fast so we have to find all sorts of things to burn in the train to keep it running so that we don't break down in the middle of the desert and get attacked by a bunch of spooky Roblox Zombies! Adley was really good at driving the train, so we had her drive the train most of the time while Dad and Niko were on the lookout for towns, supplies, bandits and of course Zombies! Dad was the pro at taking the bandits to jail and making money that way while Niko like usual was really good at figuring new things out and fighting off TONS of zombies at a time! We don't know how far we have to drive this train to win but we won't stop until we find the cure!\n\nAfter we were done with Dead Rails, we had a little bit more time for a BONUS game! We decided to hop into a spooky shopping mall game for a bit! In this one, we had to run around this giant mall and build a fort while creepy monsters would try and get us! Adley tried making a big couch fort but Niko's idea was to try and get up high where he couldn't get grabbed!\n\nThanks for watching!! BYE!
