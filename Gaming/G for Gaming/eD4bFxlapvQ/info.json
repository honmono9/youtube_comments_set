Today we're playing a game you might've heard of since it became SUPER popular on Roblox! We got Adley, Niko, Navey & Dad together to play this scary Roblox game called 99 Nights in the Forest! Only Niko had played this before so he was making sure to teach us all how to survive this creepy game! We had to first get wood and build up our camp with a campfire and then also get food so we don't starve! After that we were just exploring all over for supplies and gear!! But we have to be careful! When night falls, creepy things start to happen. This crazy giant deer came and attacked us at our camp but we shined our flashlights on him and he ran away! Later on we even found aliens in the forest who were attacking us with their laser blasters! But, the most important part was the missing Roblox kids in the forest that we had to find and rescue! Niko & Adley found the missing dino kid and brought him back to the camp to be safe with us! There were all sorts of attacks and crazy moments that we had to make our way through! This game was fun, spooky and all over the place! Watch and see if we make it all 99 nights in this cursed forest!\n\nThanks for Watching!! BYE!
