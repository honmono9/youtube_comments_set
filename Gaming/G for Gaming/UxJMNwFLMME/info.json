So make sure you go online and VOTE 4 ADLEY for the Kid's Choice Awards!\n\nWe started out this episode by playing some Roblox Twilight Daycare and they even had an update and some special things for part of the Kid's Choice Awards coming up! We were playing crazy babies! Mom & Dad had to work together to try and wrangle up the kids while they got into all sorts of crazy situations! There was even this girl that kept trying to steal Navey and the family had to work together to try and rescue her! After playing Twilight Daycare, we went online to go and vote for all of our favorite things on the Kid's Choice Awards website! We all made sure to vote for A for Adley so that hopefully we can win an award! Then, when we were done voting we all wanted to try the Roblox Ninja Challenge game with the whole family to see who could do the best! But... we all tried our best, but this game was REALLY hard! We were all getting tired because we were seeing who could stay up the longest which made it so much harder to play this challenge! Eventually, Mom, Niko and Navey got too tired and decided to go to bed but Adley and Dad still had energy to play just a little longer. So Dad and Adley played a little bit of Roblox Card Battle together to end this G for Gaming!\n\nMake sure you go online and vote for A for Adley for the Kid's Choice Awards so that we can win big this weekend at the show!
