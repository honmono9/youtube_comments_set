                "description": "SNEAKY FOX and SPiTTiNG LLAMA 🦙🦊\n\nJOIN THE FAM - https://www.youtube.com/@GforGaming\n\nHEY EVERYBODY!! Adley, Navey and Shaun decided to get out of the big city and move out to the farm!\n\nWELCOME BACK to a brand new AWESOME episode of your favorite gaming channel on YouTube, G for Gaming! We decided to hop back on to our favorite family creating game, The Sims 4 but with a twist! This time we decided to try out the Sims 4 expansion called Cottage Living where we designed our cute little family and moved into a farm with a bunch of cute animals like kittens, adorable puppies, HUGE cows and beautiful horses! We all had to start by designing what our sim characters would like! Adley made her sim a regular kid just like her and then we decided to have Navey's character be a little toddler!  Hopefully she doesn't get up to too many crazy baby chaos but I guess you'll just have to see! Shaun let Adley and Navey create his character and for his summer outfit they wanted him to wear a fancy suit or a giant hamster costume! What?! BUT, once we got all of that sorted out, it was time to move into our new cute little Sims farm cottage! We had all sorts of cute animals but later decided since it's a farm, we need more! So, we got little baby chickens, a cow and even a fluffy llama! Later we visited our local park and Shaun tried to teach Adley how to go fishing in the river, but she just wasn't lucky enough to catch any this time! Wherever we went, baby Navey was always causing some crazy baby mischief like shouting at the cat, throwing baby powder all over and even playing in the mud!\n\nThere was way too much chaos on this cozy little farm cottage episode but it was SO much fun! There are so many other Sims 4 DLCs that we need to try out and explore!!\n\nThanks for Watching!! BYE!
