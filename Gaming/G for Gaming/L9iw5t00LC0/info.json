Welcome BACK to another extra special episode of your favorite gaming YouTube channel, G for Gaming!! Today we found a really cool and... deep game on Roblox! We found this game called 'Dig the Backyard' where we have to start with little shovels and just start digging as deep as we can in our backyard to find all sorts of treasures, secrets and even... a GiANT MONSTER WORM?! We got Adley, Niko & Dad all here to brave this crazy new underground world! Niko had already played this game before so he knew all sorts of secrets, tips and glitches to help us get even further! Dad and Adley were both really good at fighting off the zombies that we found deep down in the depths of the earth! Eventually, Adley and Niko found this giant cavern area but something was... off. We heard rumbling and then BOOM, we got attacked by the giant monster worm that was hiding down there! What?! Later, Dad went and bought X-ray goggles for digging that made it easier to find treasures like diamonds and gold and even more secret tunnels! We ended up getting SO far and dug SO deep and even found the secret giant worm tunnel/level!\n\nThanks for Watching!! BYE!
