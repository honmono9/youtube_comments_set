We are excited to be back with another video here on G for Gaming! More craziness, more silly moments and more Roblox! Today we were definitely feeling some more random Roblox games so we picked this one that was a spin on the Steal a Brainrot game! In this one Adley, Niko, Navey & Dad have to steal KPop Demon Hunter characters! It's just like the original but instead we're trying to grab mythic Rumi and Miras and derpy dogs! Adley was absolutely crushing it at number one on the leaderboard! Niko was busy trying to build up his base since he usually just plays steal a brainrot! He did eventually get the best item in the game, Rainbow Derpy Tiger! It made him so much money per second, it was crazy! But then later... Shaun got sneaky and stole it right out of his base when he wasn't expecting it! That's just what Shaun kept doing, he was always sneaking around trying to steal people's best stuff! Navey was actually number 3 in the whole server even though she spent most of her time stealing from Dad and bonking random people when they would try to steal from her! Then, Adley got her BEST iTEM stolen! So we all banded together to try and get it back for her! We tried so many different tactics but we couldn't seem to get it back without the other player stopping us! But, will we get it back for Adley? Best to watch and find out!\n\nThanks for Watching!!
