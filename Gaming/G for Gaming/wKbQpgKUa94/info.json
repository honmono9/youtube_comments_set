Welcome BACK to another brand new exciting episode of your FAVORiTE gaming channel on YouTube... G for Gaming!! Today we’ve got a SUPER extra special episode for you all today! Our friend’s over at Prodigy have this super cool game that you can play and learn REAL math & even English! We decided to try out the math game today and see what it’s all about! We got the entire family together since the kids are out of school, to keep our math skills up to par! Adley, Niko, Navey and Mom & Dad were all here! We’ve got everybody!\n\nThe Prodigy Math Game is awesome! You get transported to this fantasy land where you become a wizard and have to save the crystals that were stolen by... THE PUPPET MASTER!! First though, you get to customize your character and pick out your own wizard name! After that, you get to set out on your adventure and save the land! You even get to pick your very own pets and take them with you on your noble math quest! But, when you come across monsters, we’ll have to battle them! To charge up our magic we found out you have to solve all sorts of math equations to charge up your magic and win the battle! You can even set your level so that the math is suited for whatever grade you are in! It’s such a great way to keep your math skills sharp and even learn new things during the summer when we’re out of school, all while having fun and playing this awesome game!\n\nThanks for Watching!!
