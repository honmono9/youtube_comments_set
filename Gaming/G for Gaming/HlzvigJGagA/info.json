Have you tried our new Water Slide world in Unicorn Catch on Roblox?\n\nWelcome BACK to another wild and fun episode of G for Gaming with your favorite hosts of your favorite gaming YouTube channel Niko, Navey, Dad and a little later on Adley joins us! Today we wanted to show you all something SUPER cool that we have been hard at work on for a while with our Spacestation Apps team! We've been teasing it for a while and a lot of you have probably already tried it out. In honor of summer fun and school being out, we made a brand new way for you to cool off in Roblox! In our Unicorn Catch Tycoon we added a new level a little bit ago where you can build your own super awesome and crazy water park with all sorts of twisty slides and some even have loops! We started out with Niko, Navey and Shaun all hopping on Unicorn Catch Tycoon and get working on our new water parks!\n\nNiko & Navey were so hard at work on their parks and building new pools, slides, smoothie shops and even snack cafes! As Niko & Navey went along they even found hidden codes that were tucked away in hard to find places! If you enter in those codes you get free magic in our game that you can use to keep upgrading your water park and even getting speed boosts!! Once we had a TON of magic to spend, Niko unlocked a bunch of new slides and eventually... a GiANT NiKO TOiLET!! On top of Niko's water park, he bought a giant Nikobidi toilet! It was like a big Skibidi toilet but with Niko inside of it instead!\n\nLater on, Adley came downstairs to play with us and upgrade her own park! But since we had been playing a bunch, she had to rush and catch up with everybody else! Well, everyone except for Dad who was still stuck on the Dino world in Unicorn Catch! But that was obviously no challenge for Adley, she caught up to everybody else! Dad even finally worked hard enough to get out of the Dino world and by the end of the video, he was finally exploring the brand new island world with his very own water slide park!\n\nThanks for watching!!
