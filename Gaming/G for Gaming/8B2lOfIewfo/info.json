Welcome BACK to another brand new EPiC episode of G for Gaming! We've decided to play some more of a familiar and super fun game with as many cowboys & cowgirls as we could gather! That's right, we got Adley, Niko, Navey & Dad all together to play some more Roblox Dead Rails! To get in the mood and make sure we could pull off those crazy cowboy moves, we all put on our cowboy hats and hopped on the same train to escape the zombies and escape! We all had to work together and try and survive out in the wild wild west! We had Navey be the train driver so that she could stay on the train while Adley, Niko & Dad all worked together to hop off the train, fight werewolves and zombies and scavenge for supplies so we can make it further than we've ever gone before! We even kept getting attacked by crazy groups of cowboy bandits who were after us and trying to steal all of our hard earned supplies! We knew that teamwork would be the key to making it as far as we could together as a family and it worked! We kept getting really really far on our train but this game is HARD! So we kept restarting and trying to get further than we ever had before!\n\nWe saw and did so much! We fought off the outlaws and got their money! We explored spooky abandoned towns and houses full of scary zombies and werewolves! We even found a wanted poster for a wanted criminal, maybe we'll have to play again soon and find him and get that bounty! We love playing Roblox Dead Rails and trying to explore the undead wild west! We really had a blast!\n\nThanks for Watching!! BYE!
