Welcome back to G for Gaming, your one stop shop for the best and most fun gaming videos on YouTube! Today things are getting a little spooky around here! With Halloween coming soon, we've been getting into the spooky spirit! For this episode, we all dressed up in some fun... and spooky, costumes! Adley dressed up as a dragon-cowboy-princess? Whatever that is! Niko dresses as a cultist from 99 Nights in the Forest, Navey dressed as a witch and Dad... well he dressed up as... Banana Bowser? What?! We invited our friends to join us while we jump into some scary roblox games together! First up we played Cheese Escape! This game was a lot funnier than it was scary, we had to run around a maze that was made out of cheese and try to find pieces of cheese and keys to escape before this giant rat would try and get us! We only played for a little bit before we tried this other spooky game called Midnight Motel! In this game, we all checked into this creepy looking motel together and instantly, strange and mysterious things started happening! We did eventually beat it and survive all the way through all of the spookiness!\n\nWe have more Halloween videos coming soon so stay tuned for when those come out even closer to Halloween!\n\nThanks for Watching!!
