We're making our own challenges in Dress to Impress without even waiting for new updates!! Have you tried the Dress to Impress Black and White challenge??\n\nWeeeeelcome BACK to your favorite one stop shop for the BEST gaming videos on YouTube also known as G for Gaming! Today we have a smaller group with us, we have Adley and Saedie doing their very own episode of G for Gaming together! Adley had a super cool challenge idea that would make playing Dress to Impress on Roblox EXTRA crazy! Adley's idea was that whenever we are creating our outfits for the runway, we have to turn our color off! We have to play in black and white only! It's our Dress to Impress Black and White Challenge! We found out that if the theme had anything to do with specific colors it was REALLY hard to do it right because we had to guess and hope that we chose the right colors! Like when the theme was candycane! Adley guessed right and got the right red and white candycane colors for her outfit but when Saedie turned her color back on she was BLUE! I bet the other people playing with us are so confused! Hahaha!! Even though we had an extra challenge on our side, we still ended up winning a couple rounds and making podium!! Today was way too much fun with the challenge we made up for ourselves!\n\nThanks for Watching!! BYE!
