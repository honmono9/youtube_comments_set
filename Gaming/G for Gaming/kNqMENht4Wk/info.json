And we chose... some late night Roblox games! Adley, Niko & Navey chose to play this super fun Snakey game on Roblox with Dad where one person turns into a giant snake and has to hunt down everyone else while they search for keys and try to escape! First up, Adley was the snake! Niko is a huge fan of this game so he was super good at juking out Adley and whoever was the snake! Adley was pretty good, but not good enough and Niko, Navey and Dad got away! But, next up Navey was the snake and she was actually super good! She kept getting Niko over and over! Only Adley got away because Navey got Niko and Dad at the very end! After that, we were getting sleepy and ready for bed but we decided to play just one more game! We played some classic Roblox Natural Disaster Survival! It's always a good time for us to try and make it through some tornados, tsunamis and earthquakes! After that though, it really was time to go to bed!\n\nThanks for Watching!! BYE!
