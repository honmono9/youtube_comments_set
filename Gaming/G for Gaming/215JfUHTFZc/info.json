Did you have a chance to try the experience in Minecraft before they got rid of it?\n\nWelcome back everybody to another brand new awesome and exciting episode of G for Gaming with your favorite hosts, Adley, Niko and Shaun (and more sometimes too!)! Today we are jumping into one of our favorite classic games that we used to play all the time! Do you remember panda survival? That's right, you already know, we're back playing some Minecraft this time! But today is extra special because as you all know, a really cool movie just came out, you might know it! It's called THE MiNECRAFT MOViE!! We learned that there is an official movie experience that you could play inside of Minecraft the game so we decided we had to try it out because we all thought that the Minecraft movie was AWESOME! But, we also got some collectible Minecraft Movie trading cards from that we showed all of you before we start playing the game! After we showed our cards, we jumped into the Minecraft Movie Experience! There was a bunch of cool stuff, like at the very first area, we could walk around and see stuff from the movie like Steve's lava chicken stand! Niko was exploring a cool mine but it had a bunch of scary skeletons chasing him! Then, we found a little arcade that had a bunch of mini-games about the movie! The first one we all tried was called \"First Night Survival\" where we had to work together to fight off a bunch of zombies and pillagers! There was also another one where we had to try and fly Elytras through this crazy course with piglins and ghasts trying to stop us! We also played another game where we had to sneak into the mansion and find all the right things and sneak away from the pillagers to win!\n\nThe Minecraft Movie Experience was SO much fun and we had a blast trying it all! Hopefully they make a Minecraft Movie 2 soon because we LOVED the first one!\n\nThanks for Watching!! BYE!
