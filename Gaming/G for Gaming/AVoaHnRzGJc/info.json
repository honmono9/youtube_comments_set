                "description": "The deer is... our friend now?!\n\nJOIN THE FAM - https://www.youtube.com/@GforGaming\n\nHEY EVERYBODY!! Welcome back to yet again, another awesome episode of G for Gaming! We are extra thankful to be bringing you such a fun Roblox video! Today, Adley, Niko, Navey & Dad saw that there was a NEW update on 99 Nights in the Forest on Roblox so you know we HAD to check it out! Before we got on to play though, we may have had some sugary and syrupy french toast for dinner! Hopefully that didn't make the kids TOO hyper for the game! Well, maybe it did... Anyways, we got to explore and find all sorts of secrets in this brand new update! The most exciting part is that we got to help the deer! We had to give him a bandage and then feed him until he felt better. After that, he ran off to a cave and fought the deer that hurt him in the first place! Niko even found a secret golden chest inside the cave that had crazy good loot! Later on, when we were getting attacked the deer actually came out to help us! Dad didn't believe it at first but Niko knew that the deer was our friend! We can't wait to play part two of this update when it comes out, so make sure to check out our Part 2 right here on G for Gaming NEXT WEEK!\n\nThanks for Watching!! BYE!
