                "description": "JOIN THE FAM - https://www.youtube.com/@GforGaming\n\nHEY EVERYBODY!! Welcome back to another epic episode of G for Gaming! Today we've got a pretty special video for you since we are playing a game that none of us have EVER played before! It's called 'Grounded' and we play as a bunch of kids who got shrunk down to the size of bugs! That means that there are giant spiders! Humongous ants and jumbo beetles all over the place! To take on this crazy challenge, we got Adley, Niko and Dad all together to try and survive in this GIANT WORLD! When we all dropped into the game, we got to choose our own characters first and then we were teleported into this world where we are smaller than ants! We had to find food and water and also build ourselves a shelter to live in! We were looking all over for food and water and Adley even found a giant ladybug that she jumped on top of and rode around! The ladybugs are so cute and nice, they'll just take you for a ride for free! Niko was really into exploring and knew how to find all sorts of cool things, like a giant candy box with huge candy inside! Shaun was looking hard for \"The Mystery Machine,\" but not the one from Scooby-Doo! We we figured out how to make cool spears so that we could fight back against the mean bugs like the giant spiders and the little tiny red mites that kept biting us! Niko even found a scary giant spider! It was a giant wolf spider! Since we were getting towards the end of the video Adley and Dad dared Niko to go up and toss a pebble at the wolf spider to see what happens! Niko took the dare and threw his pebble... and the spider got him in one bite!\n\nWe had such a blast being tiny and exploring our giant back yard! Have you played this game before? Should we play more? Life really is crazy when you are so tiny!\n\nThanks for watching!! BYE!
