DiFFERENT episode of G for Gaming today! We filmed this episode on Father's Day so that we could show you all our big surprise we put together for Dad! Adley, Niko, Navey & Jenny were all downstairs waiting for Shaun to come down so they could surprise him! When he came down, first we took him to the fanciest basement turtle taco restaurant we know of! Of course, Adley and Navey were the chefs ready to take Dad's order! Of course, Dad ordered the signature Turtle Tacos and they were delicious! ...Even if they were dropped on the floor! Don't worry about that! Then, it was time to explain our surprise to Dad which was... Drumroll please... An All Night Gaming Party where we are just going to play a bunch of fun Roblox games together! We played everything from Pick the Best movie, Together and even musical chairs! All of the kids were so determined to play games all night long, or as Adley said, until AT LEAST 7:00 AM! Well... that didn't quite happen. BUT, we still had a blast playing Roblox games with Dad for Father's Day this year!!\n\nThanks for Watching!! BYE!
