Welcome back to another brand new episode of the absolute best gaming channel on all of YouTube... G for Gaming!! this time Adley couldn't play with us BUT! With how excited we've been about the Minecraft movie, we decided that for today's episode we should play some more Minecraft! We're playing Minecraft so of course, we are joined by Niko & Dad! But we also have a special guest, Niko's friend! First up, we wanted to try this crazy one block, sky block challenge! In this game, we only have a tiny little island and one block that we can break and whenever we break it, a random NEW block appears and we have to try and use these blocks to make our island bigger and better! Unfortunately, we didn't get very far so we switched over to our MAIN game of Ninjas in Zombie City! This game was way crazier! We had to sneak around and fight off all the spooky monsters and use our sweet ninja moves to sprint and parkour around the city so we didn't get oofed! We even had missions that we had to go and complete like saving someone from the evil lair or fighting off a big zombie boss! We climbed the tower, we fought the zombies and we parkoured like pros! This was a flippin' awesome game just like steeeeves lava chicken oh so tasty and good!! Hope you enjoyed this episode of G for Gaming!\n\nThanks for Watching!! BYE!
