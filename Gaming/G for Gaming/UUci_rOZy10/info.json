We are once again venturing back into the haunted, spooky forest of 99 Nights in the Forest on Roblox with Niko and Shaun! We heard that there was a new update in the game where we could find some crazy new secrets and unlocks to find! They have added these new frogs that are hopping all over and some of them are gigantic and can give you these keys that you use to unlock this sweet secret frog gate! On the other side of the gate is... a SECRET frog chest with a hidden item inside! Niko & Dad jumped in to try and figure out this RiBBiTiNG mystery! But first, Niko showed Dad this new hammer that you can use to chop down all sorts of items like a big old wolf head that you can bring back to your camp and decorate with! There's this crazy whirlpool that you have to jump in to find the frog secret! But Shaun was busy being a fisherman first unlocking all the new rods and catching cool new fish like the swordfish and a little fish that looked like Nemo! Niko had to explain to Dad how to avoid the new Owl monster in the forest that will attack you! But, if you hold still, they won't get you just like the green rainbow ghost! We tried hard to get all the frog keys and did our best! We also checked out a couple other Roblox games like Grow a Garden where Niko showed how to get the secret green bean costume! Then we checked out Steal a Brainrot and Niko taught Dad how to play it! We even did a quick run on our Roblox Challenge Tree in Rainbow Ghost Run to see if we could beat a few challenges!\n\nThanks for Watching!! BYE!
