                "description": "everyday can be a BiRTHDAY with Navey!\n\nJOIN THE FAM - https://www.youtube.com/@GforGaming\n\nHEY EVERYBODY!! Welcome back to G for Gaming! Your number one stop for your favorite gaming videos on YouTube! Today we decided to play a special session of Roblox on Berry Ave. where we let Navey choose how the entire story went! We started out with Mom and Dad who were really wanting to have their very first Roblox baby, they really wanted to adopt a cute little baby! So Shaun and Jenny went off to the day care where they found out that you can find special shiny babies that you can adopt for just $1! They found their perfect Roblox baby, Rosie! They took Rosie home and found out that the very next day was going to be her birthday!! Mom and Dad decorated with balloons, presents and friends to surprise her with an awesome day! After that they went to bed and the next day was… ANOTHER BiRTHDAY?! It was Rosie’s birthday again!! So they got more decorations, presents and friends again and threw her another party! After that, we got in our car and were supposed to go get her nails done, but we got sidetracked with some crazy situations! We also found out that ONLY in Roblox, you can get your first Roblox ice cream sandwich phone when you turn ten! And apparently… ten year olds can drive in Roblox?! Well Navey said so! She got her own princess car and drove Mom and Dad around because now it was time for them to go and get another baby!! On the way there Navey accidentally crashed into another car!! Oh wait… no! Pretend that didn’t happen! When we got to the hospital, suddenly Navey turned back into another crazy baby!! We had all sorts of crazy fun adventures in Roblox Berry Ave today! Who knew having a birthday everyday was THIS much fun!\n\nThanks for Watching!! BYE!
