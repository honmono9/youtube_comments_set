Welcome back to another BANANAS episode of G for Gaming! Today we have quite a bit of... Monkey business to get around to because we've got a brand new update coming to ALL of our Roblox games that we wanted to give you all a secret sneak peak of! If you've played a lot of Roblox then you've probably played some of those chained together type games where you have to work together with a friend to try and beat some crazy obbies! So today, we got Adley, Niko, Navey & Dad together to test out our Monkey Buddy Challenge Tree update that is coming to our Roblox experiences! In this one, you'll have to try and beat tons of A for Adley themed obbys TOGETHER with a friend! When you get to the top, you'll get a sweet FREE Monkey Buddy outfit piece as a reward! If you complete them all, you'll get a full Blue or Pink Monkey Buddy costume! We will warn you, these obbies are pretty crazy and hard! Of course, we found a glitch in the game to get THREE people in one game at a time! We used this hack to have Niko, Navey and Dad all try the obby together at the same time! BUT, it's a little harder that way HAHA! We were able to beat it a couple times but can you?\n\nThanks for Watching!! BYE!
