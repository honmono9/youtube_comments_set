Today on this BRAND new episode of G for Gaming, we've decided that we are brave enough to venture BACK into the haunted, spooky woods of Roblox's 99 Nights in the Forest! We wanted to get as far as possible this time, so today joining Adley, Niko, Navey & Dad, we have Ethan from Spacestation Apps joining us since he's basically a pro gamer! We all jumped into the same game and got started! Navey was basically our camp chef, she was always off getting food and cooking it for us. Niko, like usual, is the crafter and fighter! He was building all the defenses against the Deer and the bad guys! Niko was also the one to go off and rescue the lost kids, he saved Dino kid! Adley spent a whole lot of time trying to catch a bunny... which she eventually did! We had so many close calls with our battles and our camp but we survived for a LONG time! How long? Well, you'll just have to watch and find out!\n\nThanks for Watching!! BYE!
