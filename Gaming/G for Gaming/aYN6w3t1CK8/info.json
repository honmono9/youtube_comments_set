Today we are bringing you a CRAZY episode of G for Gaming with Niko, Dad and friends! We heard rumors that there was going to be an awesome new update on 99 Nights in the Forest on Roblox! New weapons, new enemies, new items and more! We were all so excited to try it out, we hopped on 99 Nights before the update even came out, just to be ready for it! We got surprised with an update party where the admin and developers of the game put us in a special version of the game where we got to try out all of the new stuff early! As soon as we joined in, we were getting crazy stuff right off the bat! We instantly had enough wood to completely finish our campfire before the first night even started because the admin dropped TONS of wood for us so we didn't even need to worry about it! After that we explored a little bit but then they were dropping us free new weapons to test out! We got laser cannons, tactical shotguns and even the new Infernal Crossbow that was part of the new Volcano Biome from the new update! We were especially excited to see the new big enemy type... THE GOAT! The goat has horns on his head and will charge up and rush at you when you are least expecting it! But, Niko figured out how to avoid him super fast! Then, at the end of the party... the update was finally out! BUT... we will show you what that's all about in the NEXT 99 Nights video here on G for Gaming!!\n\nTHANKS FOR WATCHING!! BYE!
