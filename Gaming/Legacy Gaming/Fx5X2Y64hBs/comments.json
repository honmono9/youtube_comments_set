Grinding money basically just means to run boring free/cheap kits, speedrun looting the map until you have 5m and can play normally again. If it was XP based people would just spend all their money and kit on good gear and wouldn't be limited to just looting the map but literally any activity that gives XP. I also think that if the intention is to keep a stitcher nearly as good as a bobcat, then the bobcat and all rare gear should at least give you an XP multiplier when equipped just for willing to be a high roller. With both suggestions, it now makes so much sense to actually use all your expensive stuff to grind the end game instead of incentivizing ratting or free loadout PVP since you would now save time on the expedition grind by bringing good gear for a harmless XP buff.",

If its not for you then its not for you but 5 million isnt crazy high in this game. 80% of the shit you find in this game you don't need (or won't need it at the time of finding it) so you can just sell it anyway. I went from 10k to 200k within 2 and a half hours of doing runs of buried city, 5 mill is very achievable in a respectable and moderate amount of time and if I didn't have it, OH WOW. its okay because it is purely optional. I swear some people say \"casual\" but they really mean \"brain dead mouth drooling idiot\" because these requirements arent that extreme for something that is OPTIONAL and SEASONSAL (by the looks of things) but be honest.

                    "textOriginal": "Lmao people in the comments really losing their mind over something optional is crazy. If its not for you then its not for you but 5 million isnt crazy high in this game. 80% of the shit you find in this game you don't need (or won't need it at the time of finding it) so you can just sell it anyway.

Since skillpoints reset, you only get a little headstart at lvl 1, but if you only get to lvl 50 before the next expedition, it's still only effectively 55 skillpoints that you have earned that time, when you could have had 80. Of course, in the end it will add up and the headstarts will become bigger but still... it will only really benefit the people that reach lvl 75 every expedition, right? :)",

As a full-time working father with family commitments, I cannot dedicate as much time as I would like, yet I still find the game enjoyable and wish to be part of this experience. At this point, I may only earn one skill point, which benefits those who can invest significant time in the game.

With the holiday season upon us and family visiting, along with my work obligations, I am still contemplating my participation. I genuinely enjoy the game and recognize that participation is not mandatory; this is simply a consideration I wanted to share.",

I personally think the permanents given to the player are not worth it at all compared to the hours you gotta go through to get there for expedition. I love the game but think they fumbeled the ball hard, especially when they could have driven demand to prestige by offering some more unique and permanent incentives to the players who give time and resources to do it. Seems they care too much about the players putting in <5 hours per week. Still boggles me why they dont give great incentives for these types of things. Cool rewards and badges of Xth prestige etc, to make the juice worth the squeeze for the players giving them the most hours. Its a win win. Your heavier players are happy, and your lighter players might dedicate more time to the game in hopes of getting there. Thanks for the 4% stash space upgrade Embark. Its not that I wont prestige this time, its that I wont be giving the game those same hours again next season, and I know alot of other players feel similiarly, and vice versa. This game would have been a meth den if they offered great incentives for max out each season.",

I quite literally deposited all of my stash, which was 232 items, into the capsule to reach the profit quota for each category and I STILL didn’t have enough. I spent damn near the full 300k currency I had to buy things to sell, still didn’t have enough. I had to grind out each category with free load outs, just to finish it, and now having zero stash left nor currency I’m basically missing out on the 5 skil points because there’s NO WAY I’ll be able to make 1m let alone 5M to even get ANYTHING. \n\nAgain, I love this game, but this is trash. I hope it backfires so they know never to do it like this again.",

You know people will drop them everything they need as soon as they wipe. But having two tiers of blueprints would also over saturate the loot pool. Unless all blueprints at wipe are the next tier. Those that don’t do the exposition should be able to use both. It would also be nice to choose one blueprint to start with but I dunno.",

I feel like the window should be open longer or always be open and have a reworked perk system for it, because if expeditions windows are too far apart it could be weird for some players that miss out on the window. While i love pvp, once you get all your tasks done its the main thing to load in and do, part of the reason i think the first week of this game was so magical is because we all had a bunch of stuff to get done and any pvp in squads would happen naturally instead of being sought out. I want to prestige because some of my favorite raids are the ones where i go in with a specific goal in mind and anything that plays out in my quest is all organic.",
