Hytale definently has the craziest backstory from getting most wanted game in 2019, most anticipated in 2021, and then best upcoming game in 2022. Then getting sold to Riot. This seemed like a great play at the time. Taking over five years from the original launch date. Riot then cancelling it. The Hytale community being the only reason hytale was saved. aka #SaveHytale. Then Simon the creator of Hypixel and co founder of Hytale to buy it back to release. Man it even goes deeper than that. I'm just so glad this game will get to see life and not just die without even getting a chance. Can't wait.",
