This guy is one of those that pretend to be your friend for a long time, then when you break up with your gf, he hits on her and tries to bang her after a week. could easily imagine its these kind of ppl reflecting the same behaviour into games xD",

Grinded for the prestige only to uninstall the game right after playing 10 matches in a row squashing rats and being killed by them half the time. Im not running around looting and trying to be friendly for 30 minutes just for some dipshit to shoot me in the back or camp extraction and wait till I’m typing on the terminal to leave and lose everything. Theres hardly any counterplay to it so the best way to beat em is simply not give them the pleasure and pick a different game.",

This game rewards horrifyingly bad behavior, and I’m growing tired of the gameplay loop because of it. \n\nI’m sick of gathering materials, upgrading my gear, organizing my loadout, loading into a map and spending 15-20 minutes looting, only to be shot in the back and forced to leave with nothing… and then having to start that process ALL over again.\n\nThe bottom line is that I shouldn’t have to adapt to these types of players, or create special strategies to deal with them. The devs either need to start actively punishing players who rat, or make it so that kill hungry players show up on your map if they frequently engage in combat. If not that, then maybe they should make PvP and PvE seperate altogether. \n\nAll I know is that if they don’t do something soon, the game will absolutely die.",

Teaming up to fight off others, so you can fight the game is not. Forced PvP discourages from using any good guns because you don't want to 'give them' to some random, next rat, just shooting you right after he said 'dont shoot'. Not using good guns prevents from progressing, thus I loose any interest in further playing the game alltogether. All because of that forced pvp, that kills the huge potential this world has. Forced PvP is the worst. Give players a choice. I'm not saying remove PvP, just add a dedicated pve mode alongside and let the player base choose which playstyle they want to focus on. Right now there is to much power in the wrong hands - players who dont want to play the game, but want to shoot you, only for the sake of shooting you. This toxic shoot first, ask questions second environment has become frustrating, unbereable and disheartening for a casual player, which i'm guessing makes the majority of the player base. Forced PvP is ruining the otherwise fenomenal experience this world is set to be.",

Then it becomes a race to the bottom.\n\nYouTube has been ruining games imo, instead of putting in the time and exploring naturally ppl just go on YouTube and watch a bunch of guides and then copy them, it's so fing lame.

Then they used the \"wanna team up?\" emote and I thought about it and used the No emote. Idiot IMMEDIATELY starts shooting at me. \n\nI run down the hall and take some cover to heal up. ANOTHER rando asshat stars shooting at me as I'm taking cover. I run back through where I know there was a friendly player and as I run through, there is yet ANOTHER player who starts firing at me. I run up some stairs, close the doors set up some mines and hide behind cover to heal. Door opens, 1 dumbass comes through and gets dropped. Through another door, yet ANOTHER rando comes in and I hear the downed guy who was chasing me (turns out to be the 2nd guy who shot me on sight for no reason) ask the guy \"Hey can you rez me?\" and the new guy says \"Sorry bro I don't have anything\" and he knocks him out. \n\nI watched the whole thing and had about 10 seconds where I could shoot the guy and kill him probably before he even finished off the guy I just knocked. I didn't though because I assumed he might be friendly since he made it sound like he wasn't opposed to rezzing the guy but had nothing. IMMEDIATELY after punching the guy out, he starts shooting me. Fucking what? That's how he repays the favor of me staring into his fucking soul and deciding NOT to shoot when he would have been dropped?\n\nThis sort of behavior in Solos is rare but I have a hunch. It was Stella Montis for one thing and the 1st game of that day for me but also, the last game I had played the day before was one where I heard a guy start shooting and realized he was shooting a player. I'm in one of the tall apartments on Buried City so I go up to try and help the guy out. The guy has already been knocked but I see the asshat trying to come and finish him off to loot him. So, I silenced Anvil his booty and he runs and hides. I throw some nades over at him to try and scare him out of his hidey hole. At some point the guy sneaks around into the other apartment building and comes up to try and confront me but his little ambush fails and I get away.\n\nSo, if the \"if you shoot other players you'll be placed in lobbies with other shooters\" thing COULD be true but it's kinda bullshit that even playing defensively to try and help another player who is being player-killed would count. The game should somehow analyze aggression versus protectiveness.",
                    "textOriginal": "I had some asshat come up to me saying \"Don't shoot\" and I reciprocated. Then they used the \"wanna team up?\" emote and I thought about it and used the No emote. Idiot IMMEDIATELY starts shooting at me. \n\nI run down the hall and take some cover to heal up. ANOTHER rando asshat stars shooting at me as I'm taking cover. I run back through where I know there was a friendly player and as I run through, there is yet ANOTHER player who starts firing at me. I run up some stairs, close the doors set up some mines and hide behind cover to heal. Door opens, 1 dumbass comes through and gets dropped. Through another door, yet ANOTHER rando comes in and I hear the downed guy who was chasing me (turns out to be the 2nd guy who shot me on sight for no reason) ask the guy \"Hey can you rez me?\" and the new guy says \"Sorry bro I don't have anything\" and he knocks him out. \n\nI watched the whole thing and had about 10 seconds where I could shoot the guy and kill him probably before he even finished off the guy I just knocked. I didn't though because I assumed he might be friendly since he made it sound like he wasn't opposed to rezzing the guy but had nothing. IMMEDIATELY after punching the guy out, he starts shooting me.

I would call a rat a person who calls \"don't shoot\" and kills you after you turn your back on them. But just playing the game, try to get to good loot locations and kill other players is just part of the game.",

I normally run a default of lure grenades and adrenaline stims to get me quickly from point A to point B.

Most of the grenades have enough of a delay that they allow fast reflexes to prevent or mitigate the majority of their effect.

Not that difficult IMO. I think there should be a few seconds after being shot in the back to allow you to roll and arm your self - at least gives you a slight chance for a fight back. The way it is now there is no chance, at least in my experience.",

The only fix I can think of is that the devs reduce PVP damage taken at the rear by 75%. The fact that 1 clip from a Stitcher can kill you dead is poor design. And it results in PVP in this game being utter BS. I don’t mind dying when it’s an exchange of damage and I’m out PVPd. But when shooting first practically guarantees a win, then again it poor design. If the devs don’t fix this. In 12 months time there’ll be ZERO PVEers playing and just a handful of PVPers, who are no doubt a little bit bored of killing each other.",
