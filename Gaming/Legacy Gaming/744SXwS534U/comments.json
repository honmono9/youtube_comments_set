Yes it creates a slight imbalance but if you give everyone everything it takes away from the grind excitement when you finally get one! Also the quests give some really good blueprints which 100% makes them worth it and worth the time. Also they shouldn’t be easy runs! Quests that give the hillcracker blueprint should take a few try’s etc! Embark do not listen to most this video please!!!!",

They just hide and spring surprise attacks where in a map like Stella Montis, it’s hard to get away and heal.  So the guy that shoot first usually wins.  I get that it happens at times and is part of the game.  I’ve had 5 rounds in a row with this crap now while trying to find a flow controller.

It's no secret that content locusts are just here to milk out money from video games and pull in a lot of idiots with them, they're not actual gamers so all I can do is drop a small turd when I get things like this in my feed.

They need a boss and token system similar to Hunt Showdown.\nA way to reliably track down an arc boss, have said boss drop a core or other item that constantly pings on the map for all players to chase down or prevent original player from extracting with it, If Arc Raiders had that, it will stand the test of time.",

Nothing worse than getting dumped halfway through just to get ratted and lose all your nice stuff. People literally camp spawns in stella with torrente's and stichers",

I totally had situations in stella montis where I would spawn right behind the other player who didnt even leave the room yet. They do need to prioritize custom loadouts spawning in fresh raid. Its getting very frustrating when you come in kitted with a key or two at 18 min of the raid... They also need to deal with extraction campers somehow, especially at burried city nights. That map is already a rat fest but extraction point camping is so very frustrating.",

They've already done the excessive grind to level 75, and now they just repeat the same broken meta, completely ruining the experience for everyone else.\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that streamer content is driven by finding and exploiting issues, which then becomes the annoying, repetitive content that forces everyone to play a miserable meta.\r\n\r\nRepetitive and Annoying Content: Streamers constantly run custom, expensive loadouts that are only viable if they get a fresh map. When they don't, they immediately extract for a reset, making their live content a boring, constant reset loop. This isn't entertainment; it's a frustrating highlight of the game's flaws.\r\n\r\nRuining the Game with Exploits: Streamers are the ones who ruined the key room system by broadcasting how to use glitches that allowed players to break into loot locations without the necessary key card. This imbalance in the community was caused by those players who leaned heavily into the exploit to juice their loadouts insanely quick, effectively ruining the progression for honest players. They're about to be exposed as frauds because they only know how to play the game the cheap way.\r\n\r\nRuining the Experience with Meta-Chasing: Their content is geared toward farming repetitive trial challenges, like those requiring damage to flying enemies, which boils down to repeating the same farming loops using snitch scanners. Streamers constantly do this same, uninspired farming content to rack up tens of thousands of points, forcing others to do the same to compete].\r\n\r\nDo Not Meddle in Game Creators' Jobs\r\nThe most frustrating part is their meddling in the game creator's jobs with their constant, uninformed complaints and suggestions.\r\n\r\nDemanding Unfair Weapon Balance: Streamers constantly complain about weapon balance, not because they care about the game's health, but because they need an unfair edge for their content. The Venador, for instance, remains the go-to for most players thanks to streamers popularizing its exploit-like efficiency. They find every weapon glitch (like the Il Toro animation cancel) and quickly make it the annoying meta. They then act like they are experts, demanding developers introduce more technical tools when they are the ones who broke the balance in the first place.\r\n\r\nExacerbating Technical Issues: Their aggressive, high-risk playstyles, purely for \"content,\" are what make technical issues like desync  feel so much worse. They constantly demand complete overhauls to systems like quests and blueprints, acting like they know how to design a better game.\r\n\r\nThe Advice to Streamers:\r\n\r\nStop ruining the game and creating this annoying, repetitive content. Your job is to entertain, not to dictate game design or find every exploit to make the game miserable for the casual player. Do not meddle in game creators' jobs like you know something about it. The developers would have an easier time addressing these issues, if you would just stick to playing the game as intended",

I always hate joining maps that are already in progress, no matter what gear I bring. Honestly, this feature should just be removed. I’d rather wait a few extra minutes in matchmaking than spawn into a half-finished match where everything’s already looted and other players already have all the advantages. Whenever that happens, I just leave right away — there’s just no point staying. \n\nAnother issue is the lack of spawn protection. I even got killed once right after spawning, which is just unacceptable (not sure if it’s been fixed).\n\nI do agree, though, that blueprints need a serious rework. Basic blueprints and powerful ones like Hullcracker or Wolfpack should be obtainable as quest rewards. But all blueprints should still remain findable on the maps as well — just with better balancing. Right now it’s way off. I’ve spent around 65 hours topside and only got about 37 blueprints (mostly thanks to friends giving me their extras). Without that help, I’d probably be stuck at maybe 25.",

The Venator DOES NOT need a nerf to its damage output, it fires 2 rounds per trigger pull, this is logical. It should definitely consume 2 rounds per shot from its magazine however. This is all it needs. The Rattler and Bettina need attention, the Rattler 1 is incapable of putting a player down in a single magazine even without a shield (90 dmg) and only reloads 2 bullets at a time. Make it make sense Embark! The Bettina has too low a DPS for its ammo grade and has too high a wear rate. Why would anyone bother considering the cost? IMO, higher grade weapons should have a lower wear rate and greater accuracy compared to lower tier weapons. Maybe even higher upgradability. This would make the rarer weapons worth the effort and cost. Common weapons no upgrade, uncommon 1 upgrade, rare 2 upgrades and epics 3 upgrades. Or maybe how many attachments they can run? Something to differentiate the common guns from the rarer ones without touching the power of any of them. This would represent the greater quality and fit and finish of the blue and purple/pink weapons over the white and green. Lastly, they should allow people to insure at least one of their guns, this would go a long way in reducing the complaints over rats and extraction campers. It would be really easy for them to implement, the system already exists in the engine.",

In it he raided 100 Security lockers and got 2 Blueprints, JUST 2! That’s just absurd! You dump all of those points into that skill branch and that’s your reward, trash, not to mention having to fight other players off to raid these in time. As a Solo player I would really like ALL of these Blueprints to be completely random, you could open a locker and blam, there’s the seeker grenade blueprint. At this point I have been grieved so much during extraction that I now hide for a few times when the extract is called and wait it out, 7 out of 10 times I will hear some poor luck player getting murdered by some camping scum. Plus If I wait it out and I hear a player stay around after they had that window to leave and didn’t, that tell me all I need to know about what type of player they are. I’m at level 39 and have yet to kill a single raider, it’s not how I want to play nor is it why i bought the game in the first place. While i am on a rant, there needs to be player immunity once a player interacts with the extraction console. These scum that kill you with no time to loot you is just senseless bs IMO. And before anyone says the same “ it’s an extraction shooter blah blah blah, my opinions are just as valid as yours so save it.",

Without the blueprint reset the game would stale out way faster since it would essentially eliminate and entire subset of loot.

If something is not done you'll end up with the worst of the worst and the good members of the community, who are the vast majority, will simply quit playing. When that happens a game rarely recovers and instead of seeing Raiders grow and flourish it will slowly die hateful grief fueled death.\n\nThat should be Embark's largest priority as these same griefers are the majority of the ones engaged in exploits, hacks, spawn camping, etc. The Spawn rotation and balancing loot availability should be #2, followed by Blueprints at #3. Many of us have nothing left to strive for except Blueprints and now after the extreme nerfs to availability and all that's dropping +95% of the time is the same 2 dozen blueprints, there's really little reason to play, especially with Embark taking a \"hands off\" approach to griefing. Funny how it's ok to ruin the fun of other players but a gun that damages Arc too efficiently is treated like an urgent matter...\n\nMark my words, if the griefing is not addressed and Embark does not act to curtail it then Raiders will go downhill from here. Some of you might not care but remember, less players means less revenue/resources which means a limited lifespan and far less additional content.

I gave the medium gun parts blueprint to a guy which I found in a match yesterday that still didn't have it. And I lack so many so I bought a hull cracker at an earlier point for the time when I got the quests and needed items from the rocketeer but then they nerfed it. So its completely useless to kill things it was made to kill, and the rocketeer is just dumb to play against. Sometimes it just fires once it sigth pass by you and you almost dead. You don't even see that it gets a lock, because it just fires when it's trying to balance itself from left or right or back to front when it just fires a shot completely random. And if wolf packs were more reasonable and not so rare I would use them all the time but this game got a load of things to fix like either let you keep blueprints, making the new versions v2 and slightly better at certain things or make the season 1 blueprints unusable, but they must have thought of this right? If there are people that are loading up friends characters with items that will let them skip the whole process for them they will ruin the game for the rest. And some will just leave. Others might adapt. But im done with this game if they can't find a better system for the blueprints tbh.... Being able to craft blueprints from items found in the world. Let's say \"old schematics for automatic medium ammo rifle/gun and craft them into medium gun parts ammo for guns. The reason I'm adding for guns is if it's possible to craft it you need to have more starting recipes if you don't randomly find it in the world. . It really doesn't matter because the fact is that unless you are full on pvping every match you are lagging behind because you need things from areas of all parts of the map and when you never spawn in at points where stuff you need are the atmosphere of the game is gonna be pretty different in season 2 and I'm getting really tired of lagging behind just because it's impossible for me to kill a rocketeer just to get killed before I can loot it. After they turned the hull cracker into dogshit your fight with the rocketeer can last long enough to have the whole map converging on the parts dropping once you kill it and leave you with nothing... No there are many things that ruined season 1 and have made impossible to compete and complete all the quests alone because I truly want a reset. I think the game already needed a reset at the point where blueprint drops were changed and lowered because that was so unfair and such a fundamental change in the middle of a season even if it was the first should be changed to will be rebalanced during the expedition window. Because it made such a huge gap between people that already had most of the items and had friends they could play with 24/7.. I don't have friends that play this game. And queuing against premades in this game is just being cannon fodder for the premades. Yea, there are loads of things to change for the next season and I hope embark has been paying attention because this season will make or break this game. It already sold half of what I thought it would, and there are so many things the game should have started with, like an open beta so they could iron out the kinks and balance issues that now have split the community in three. Those who joined late and just try to keep up. Those who joined alone and are struggling to keep up and catch up by all means and ruining the game for everyone else. And : those who are already max level with all the blueprints and have found a bunch of friends to go out and farm items they need for the next season if embark hasn't locked that shit down.\nAnd I part with some last words. If the game doesn't get some catchup mechanisms to make up for the huge flaws the game has got because of their not so well thought out fixes in the middle of a season this game is inherently flawed and will fail after the second season. There is no reason they couldn't wait to fix weapon balances until the expedition window, I don't even mind having some weapons being changed and or harder to get in some seasons and this is why you start a game like this without all the features locked in. It pisses me so fricking off that I will probably miss the first expedition window because they didn't choose to start the game out by balancing all the stuff out. Then reset and start the countdown for the first expedition. Frick off embark,",

This team doesn't have the resources to create this anytime soon. They have said this which is unfortunate. It's going to be too slow to churn out anything meaningful for long-term play for anyone.",

My Two Cent comment for the day.\n\nCause it's a great game, but I am tired of dying mostly from others, YES get good.  But sometimes random other things can get you too.  But I say A Only PVE mode as this game was only supposed to be a PVE game to begin with.  On in the PVE/PVP Mood more better looting as 40% for higher risk higher reward.  And Yes make the Keys worth a use.  Sometimes I only got Greens and Blues.  Before or during the the glitch.  So yeah sorry for a long comment here @LegacyGamingUS",

It's a fabulous game, so much atmosphere and has to be the best sound design in game ever, but battling your way to a lift and getting mullered by a camper just isn't fair.

Having been in game development my entire professional life and running studios, any good CMO knows that the PVE and PVP players are in different camps, want different things and expect a different experience from their time in game. Surely there are folks in the middle, but the market data supports that games like HD2 work because they are focused on one side of the coin, and most battle royales such as PUBG and Fortnite serves the other. Mixing the two almost never ever ever ever works. And the data to support this is overwhelming - Dune Awakening, every single MMO etc. Now Arc has done arguably the best job of trying to find that elusive middle ground....but ultimately has failed to find it. Folks are divided. Embark has a choice. Door one is to continue to do what they are doing  - this is unlikely to work long term because the toxicity of the mixing will cause too many \"friendly players\" to leave. Door two is to start making major tweaks as Cody suggests to spawn points, loadout rules and whatnot. This is likely to make some differences but unfortunately does not fundamentally address the foundational issue - which is there are multiple camps and they are firmly entrenched. Door 3 is to provide a PVE option where Loot is completely separate, ARCs are far more prominent in PVE mode etc. This is the obvious choice. And doing this will only enhance the game's popularity. It wont affect those that continue to login to the PVPVE mode - so those who want that experience need not apply as a change like this won't negatively impact the game.",
