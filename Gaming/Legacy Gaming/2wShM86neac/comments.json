I get the entire concept for sure, but I didn't realize it would push me away this fast. I only play when my friends are on now and currently on casual mode and have no plans to even do all these tedious tasks due to a very high chance of runs ending up a total bust. Even on non-greedy runs, somehow, either a rat or just agressive players that's always rambo mode just to loot my lvl 2 loot augment haha. Don't get me wrong, I win at times but the ratio of wasted time vs productive ones are too far apart and I'm the type of person who hates wasting time. In real life, career, etc., I don't like wasting time. This game's entire design considers it part of the game and that's where my conundrum starts",
                    "textOriginal": "I thought this game genre made me excited playing shooters again but after a series of unlucky raids ending with only 1 loot taken home each time and exhausting the gear I've stocked up since the beginning, I've started going back to my other games and stopped dedicating too much time playing this atm. I get the entire concept for sure, but I didn't realize it would push me away this fast. I only play when my friends are on now and currently on casual mode and have no plans to even do all these tedious tasks due to a very high chance of runs ending up a total bust. Even on non-greedy runs, somehow, either a rat or just agressive players that's always rambo mode just to loot my lvl 2 loot augment haha.

Although most skills won't make or break your character, being able to fully maximize to 36 (or even more) 2 skill trees plus have the third one with more points than other people would definitely flip the scales in favor to those who do them. Imagine having a lot of the skills in mobility at 5/5 or unlocked while also being able to breach security lockers, while also having bonus stuff from conditioning. Do you get additional points over 75 while doing the expeditions? If so, how do they give them to you? Is it once the season ends or do you start getting them through certain thresholds?",

There is no growing perk, single occurrence however much you earn and it reverts back at onset of next expedition. That being said if the perk is sizable like may be worth perusing but if its just something like extra 30 skill points not worth releveling everything.
