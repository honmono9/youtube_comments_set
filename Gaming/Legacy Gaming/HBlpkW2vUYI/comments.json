He'd been playing for a few days and I was completely new to it. This video explained a LOT of things I didn't know. I truly hope that as they further develop the game they'll make the encounters richer and more engaging because even with 4 hours of play I noticed a bunch of our missions there was no point whether on foot or in the ship fighting the enemies. We had to do whatever the objective was because the enemies would never stop spawning. And that's not a great thing. It makes the world feel fake. It makes combat feel pointless - because the game just wants you to \"do that objective of pressing the button or moving an object from point A to point B\". Hopefully they add more depth because damn it was fun but I could very much see how thin it was with combat being pointless because of non-stop spawning",
