While trying to do missions, I often just get hunted by pvp players and then get cussed out in game chat. Honestly, if I get killed by somebody and they start cussing me out I just report them. I hope they all get band. That's why I left COD back in the day. Got tired of getting cust out all the time for no reason. This game is so much more then just another pvp game. It's a PVPVE game. We don't always have to kill each other. We can gang up on the big Arc enemies.

I come from a point where I dont enjoy the pvp and its just trash.  95% of pvp in this game is people getting shot in the back and no retaliation.  I dont find that fun.  You think pvp will give this game legal and I believe not giving solo pvp only will send it back to the niche genre.  People are saying separating the playerbase will end the game but your wrong.  Pvpers are gonna get bored of shooting people that arent shooting back eventually and pvers are jus gonna quit because getting shot in the back with no way to respond isnt fun either.  So separating them to their playstyle will give the game a way longer playtime.  I dont know I'm not bad a the pvp it just isnt fun.  If I wanted a pvp shooter experience I'd play one of the other big shooters.  I guess making a pve solo experience with a ton more arc sounds like way more fun to me.",

There are some really gross ppl in gaming, we all know it and I feel like that isn't really being addressed by ppl on YouTube etc. That is the main reason why ppl want a pve mode, it's got way less to do with gear fear and all that sht, it's got far more to do with toxic ppl. Unfortunately squads in arc is basically a pvp free for all and that makes playing with friends who arent into pvp basically a non starter, I love solo and I like the mix of pve and pvp in solo but man I want to play this with friends.

Then about fragmenting the player base, wrong again because PVE & PVP caters to 2 different kind of gamers and actually to 2 different kind of people: there is the kind that like to cooperate with fellow humans and the kind that prefers to fight them. Totally different mentality. And when you say that eventually PVE players will get use to PVP it's just mesmerizing. No, big no. It's like telling a team of footballers that they are going on a game against a basketball team on a tennis court and get use to it because that's final. And casuals have nothing to do with it, I am a hardcore gamer but I just don't enjoy PVP, I prefer exploring, crafting and fighting as a team against giant enemies. And when you force PVP on me, it's not working, I don't like it, i have never liked it &  I will never like it. And when the toxic PVP crowd will show up (they already did tbh...) then I will just quit . So no , you don't fragment, you loose part of the player base. While if you have a PVE mode only you have players like me who would love to co-opereate with other randoms to kill a queen. I will probably never kill a queen because of PVP and all the tryhards & grieffers that come along. \nThen you say there is no excitment/emotions without the human element? Well let me tell you about a game called Helldivers 2: or do I need to? You see my point? I have & will never play warzone/tarkov/fortnite but I have spent days & nights on Helldiver and I still go back from time to time.\nI am only level 10 and I know I would love the game without PVP but I will probably give up soon, after a few  too many bad encounters. Also right now the gameplay it induce is really lame for us (PVE players) for example, I go to do my missions but if I don't get killed right away (I have personally not even shot once at another player!), I will eventually get a rare loot and therefore run immediately to the closest exit...\nAlso what is the pleasure for PVP players to kill people that are not even fighting them? That are just not in the same mindset? What's the pleasure of killing a level 2 with no loot?\nAnd why do you call that a match? For people like me it's not a match, it's a session in an adventure. There is a real misconception here. We all are supposed to fight arc but because of PVP we fight each other and no shit gets done!!!!",

I don't think people will miss anything if the PvP Part becomes less likely. Even Shroud said there are simply too many ppl on one map and it's true and I said it from the start as well. At almost every extraction there are at least 5 people at once fighting over it (or someone camping it) and in Duos or Trios you cannot even try to kill a Bastion without 4 teams showing up - it's just too much PvP - at least on EU Servers (and yes I already deactivated Crossplay for less Kiddos). You cannot even do Trials or if you manage to do 3 stars somehow, you get killed at the Extract (and during events/double XP there are not Raider Hatches, without double XP Trials become almost undoable due to too many players spawning). It's overall a very, very frustating experience. They should either add a trial mode with only you spawning in and no possibility to take loot with you, or really lower down the spawn rate (why do ppl even spawn in until min 17? All you can really do then is looking for a fight if you still want loot and it doesn't make the game better imo).",

What kind of price?  maybe a trackable flag on their head for 5 minutes that labels then a murder with a head count over last 30 days or all time.  The bounty on them would be what they looted.   It would add excitement for THEM too.. imagine trying to extract when anyone near extraction point will see you are a wanted man.  You talk about excitement of risk.. how about that as a compromise?",

Nothing feels worse than losing a fight because mobs piled on you. Division solved this with the Dark Zone and the rogue timer — it gave structure and fairness.\n\nThey also need squads of 4. Three is such a weird number when most people play with two friends or their kids. Solos/duos/quads would be perfect.\n\nNot hating at all — I love the game and your content has helped me a ton. Just giving a perspective from an older gamer with limited time. Casual players will bounce if they keep getting blasted by no-lifers with OP loot.\n\nThanks for the review, I’ll keep watching.",

I don't like getting a great build together only to lose it all when I'm in there. I'd much rather be able to keep my build if I die, but still lose the new content I've collected that round, that way it doesn't feel like such a slap in the face and it gives the game a sense of levelling up, whereas currently it feels kind of pointless to me.\n\nI also feel massively overwhelmed by the shear number of items I can collect and what they are used for, what's worth keeping, what's not etc, it just doesn't feel well explained when you start.\n\nAnd just a small thing, the inventory menu needs a LOT of upgrading imo. When you open it you have to move off an item and back onto it to see  it's description, which in a game where you have to be quick or you'll get downed, is a very slow process. Also when I've been looking at an item and I choose to break it down, why when I come out of that item does it move my cursor to the other side of the inventory, so I then have to scroll back to the left to get to the next piece each time?! It's soooo frustrating!\n\nI'm really hoping over time they'll add things to address these issues, but atm I'm finding it more frustrating than enjoyable.",

Feel like that's the true essence of the game loop and what makes this game special. You'd be taking all of that away on a PVE only server.",

I agree that if this were only pve it would get stale fast. The pvp element ( though at times frustrating )gives the game the special sauce. Each raid is a story and nothing comes easy. There are plenty of relaxing survival games out there. This is an extraction adventure, part of that adventure is the constant threat of death on the surface. I dont like getting lit up and looted but i wouldnt change the game ( other than getting rid of all the streamers ) 😂",

But the one thing I don't want them to see them do is change the fundamentals of the game. People are scary. Running into people is scared. I should always be a thing. We should always be the freedom to betray and kill on site \n\nSo the first thing make Matchmaker pair stronger based off of kill death ratios. If you're dying a lot and you're not killing, a lot of people pair you with other people who are experiencing the same thing. It's not quite PVE, but it does mean that you're more likely to have the talking conversations that you looked forward to. They'll be less people who are bloodthirsty and kill on site in those lobbies and vice versa. If you have a lot of kills then pay you with people who have a lot of kills. That's obviously the play style you want to enjoy and it just makes sense now. Does this guarantee that you're going to be in a lobby without somebody who's going to backstab you or kill you? That's what I like about this. It doesn't guarantee anything. It just says we push playstyles together but we don't guarantee it just like duos doesn't guarantee you're going to be in a Duo \n\nThe second thing is have an event doesn't have to be. You know too crazy. Use the harvester as a baseline. Have an event like to harvester but PVE only. Maybe throw in that Baron when you get the Baron out. Some of that multiple teams and multiple people are going to have to take down and maybe double the amount of Arc on the map. You know like the parents there they're out in force. Make the art super dangerous. You die. You still lose all your stuff. It doesn't change the fundamentals of the game. No. Cody on that level is going to be happening. You die. You lose your stuff. Other raiders can loot your your dead body. It's just other raiders can't kill you during that event. An event only pops up once every 3 to 5 hours. So it is a nice just breath when it pops up. But it's not going to give you up PVE only mode and but it will give you a breath",
