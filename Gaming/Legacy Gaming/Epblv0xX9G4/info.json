In this video, we break down everything you need to know before jumping in — from how the PvPvE extraction system works, to class loadouts, movement mechanics, and team-based combat. Whether you’re diving solo or with friends, understanding how to survive the ARC invasion could make all the difference.\n\nWe’ll cover gameplay details, weapon systems, loot progression, and what makes ARC Raiders stand out from other extraction shooters in 2025. Plus, we’ll talk about the upcoming Server Slam and what it reveals about the game’s final launch state.\n\nIf you’re a fan of titles like The Division, Escape from Tarkov, or The Finals, ARC Raiders might be your next big obsession.
