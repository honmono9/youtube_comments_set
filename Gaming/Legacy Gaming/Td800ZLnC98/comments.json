Legendary weapons should not be Overpowered.... they should have different use. Wich they have... kill big arcs.... There is a reason it is this way and you would never get it. \n\nThey dont want unfair pvp and gameplay. If all the chads have all the legendary weapons no one of you would be able to play the game cus only the rich kids and chads would wipe every group and every person. Its about fairness and to not break a beautiful system they have. Other extraction shooters struggle with this. Unless your a gave developper or high rank in video games you should not talk or have opinions on all of this different type of stuff.\n\nThis is not cod or xbox playstation, get with the system and understand this is almost the most fair game on the market atm so be quiet",

The hullcracker is basically good for wasp, and hornet killing now. A dude asked me if I was missing on a bastion yesterday because it was taking so long. I didn’t upgrade it, nor would I upgrade a hullcracker at this point. If you want to fire shots from far away, it could still be useful, and more quiet than a ferro, but eh. It was underwhelming. I gave one away to a dude that started a bastion fight, and I came in after with the hullcracker to do the majority of the damage. It was focused on me the whole time, so it still packs a punch, but there’s just better, quicker, and cheaper ways now. I don’t care about losing a hullcracker which makes it more friendly to bring into raid now though, so there’s that. I have a bunch of them, so I’m just using them until I lose them. I lost one to a rocketeer, and one to a random PvP encounter yesterday, and you still feel the funk of losing, but eh. It’s not even that serious overall. I actually didn’t weapon swap and hit the player with a hullcracker round on the first shot instead of my ferro. Had no chance after that. Hearing the “plop” instead of a ferro shot and a shield break made me laugh at myself. I just stood in my smoke from the broken shield, and invited the death.",
