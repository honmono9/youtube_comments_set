I even I promised him that I will sing a wedding celebration for him one day as his request somewhere around 15 years ago.\n\nI remember I had told him that if he ever plan to get married please don't schedule the day around end of January since I usually go to the US, but surpassingly He sent me an invitation printed on the same day as my flight schedule.\n\nHe demanded to make a video for his wedding then he could play while the event. So, not only practicing the song but also I got the job to edit the video while my super busy daily schedule. I was very sick but needed to smile on the video, hoping not too many people on his wedding would notice I'm a metalhead; they are mostly christians\n\nI think I kinda sensed how happy he is because he barely have contacted with me since then.\n\nDon't make a promise that is too far so you cannot foresee.\n\nFU, my friend, I wish your happiness. \n\nfrom Sieg\n\nSiegfried Song (Symmetric Chaos, South Korea) - Lead Vocals, Harmony Vocals, Video Editing\n\n[Siegfried Song]\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SiegfriedSong...\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SymmetricChaos/\n\n#YouRaiseMeUp #JoshGroban #Cover",
