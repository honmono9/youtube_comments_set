                "description": "Hello everyone,\n\nAfter revisiting Hazbin Hotel's first season, I knew I had to dive into the new material. Gravity hit differently - there's something raw and powerful in this song that demanded a metal treatment.\n\nIf you're familiar with the original, you'll find it interesting to compare how we transformed it. This is what we live for as musicians - finding that perfect storm where the original's emotion meets our sound, and everything just clicks. Patrick and I pushed each other hard on this one, and you can hear it in every riff and every note.\n\nSome songs just need to be covered. This was one of them.\n\nCredits:\nVocals, Mixing & Mastering - Siegfried Song\nLead Guitar, Rhythm Guitar & Arrangement - Patrick Fallang\n\nPlease support with likes, subscriptions, and comments!\nWhat's your favorite part of this metal version? Let me know!\n\n#HazbinHotel #Gravity #MetalCover #VivziePop #Season2 #Lute #Adam",
