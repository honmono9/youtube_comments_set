I have broken the rules of my life for her quite a bit and it was one of them. \n\nI didn't have any instrumental tracks at that time so I gave her just voice file. Today, I back to the time and remastered this one again for you.\n\nIf you like this song, please visit my facebook page.\nThank you.",
