Projecting my emotions to the music of RUSH was a very new attempt for me and we did not have enough time to polish the video, but I think we got quite interesting results. Please, visit Adreas' channel he will absolutely please you :)\n\nBy the way, I'm struggling to make a new series on my YouTube channel. If you like my singing then stay tuned, I'll be back shortly!\n\nSiegfried Song (Symmetric Chaos, South Korea) - Lead and Harmony Vocals\nAndrea Boma Boccarusso (Lock The Basement, Italy) - All Instrumentals and Video Editing\n\n[Siegfried Song]\nhttp://www.facebook.com/SiegfriedSong...\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SymmetricChaos/\n\n[Andrea Boma Boccarusso]\nhttps://www.facebook.com/AndreaBoccarusso/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/BomaMetalhead",
