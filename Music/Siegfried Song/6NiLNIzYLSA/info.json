It's just a cover song, but a bit shy, so it took a lot of effort to sing in front of the crowd. Nevertheless, I sang this song during the rehearsal and received a lot of applause, and my first attempts seemed to go pretty well until the actual show. I couldn't get on stage without knowing why. After the show, the moderator gave me a reason. One teacher didn't like Japanese songs and he asked to cancel. Since then I have lost my confidence and needed seven more years to get on stage.\n\nI have lived a life of being denied myself by others. I had been rotting in obscurity for too long to say, \"It's just a matter of time. I haven't had any luck yet.\" I might reaching my peak without any sound. There is no time left.",
