I could feel his charisma every time Rob's scream broke out, and I thought the band deserved to be called metal itself.\n\nA Touch of Evil is a song I've sang about a million times. But as I got older, I was busy and didn't have time to listen to classical metal often. Then earlier this year, Jose Nistal from Spain suggested a collaboration for this song, and I accepted it without any hesitation. No special practice was required to sing along to this song, because not only Jose's performance was excellent, but Judas Priest's sound is also close to my ultimate goal even for now.\n\nThis song was mixed and mastered by Jotun Studio in Spain. Especially, for the vocal part he used Gem Voice sponsored by Over Loud.\n\nJudas Priest - A Touch Of Evil (Cover by SIEG)\n\nSiegfried Song (Symmetric Chaos, South Korea) - Lead Vocals and Video Editing\nLeo Peña (Jotun Studio, Spain) - Bass Guitars, Drum Programming, Harmony Vocals, Mixing, Mastering and Producing\nJose Nistal (Jose Nistal, Spain) - Rhythm Guitars and Lead Guitars\nAlex Nasla (Witherfall, US) - Keyboards\n\n►Spotify\nAvailable Soon\n\n►Google Play\nAvailable Soon\n\n►iTunes\nAvailable Soon",
