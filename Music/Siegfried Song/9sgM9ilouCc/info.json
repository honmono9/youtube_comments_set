At the time, there were many requests from people around me to sing this song. In fact, I got used to the songs from an early age, so I tested it and recorded it right away. Many people expected his style, so I imitated his song, but I wasn't very satisfied.\n\nNot only imitating the song, but because I didn't get my hair cut to save money during my vacation, and the hair style was so messy that I was too embarrassed to show it to someone.\n\nAlmost 10 years later I release this song to my fans. I hope they like it.\n\nIf you like this song, please visit my facebook page.\nThank you.",
