                "description": "When I first saw KDA's POP/STAR on YouTube last year, I was very curious about the connection between metal and K-POP. So I wanted to change the song to my own style and the result was very satisfying.\n\nThis year, the release of a wonderful song with another style blew my mind. A rich combination of KDA's unique K-POP and hip-hop!\n\nHowever, my worries were ahead. What interpretation should we approach this song with? At that moment, I remembered Patrick from Norway, who had a wonderfully written Symphonic Metal before. I told him my passion for this song, and he readily agreed, so the project went on.\n\nWe studied and dig deeper into this song, exchanging calls and countless tracks. A week later, when he sent me his first demo track, his arrangement was so magnificent and beautiful and made me smile. Now I have a clear path to how I should sing this song.\n\nBut can I really rap well enough to fit this epic style?? Can I really bring out Kali's rapid fire rap into my own?? For the first week, my practice didn't have a sing to end. However, after I rap for two weeks continuously, the rhythm that I could use started flowing out of my mouth. By the end of my practice, as Patrick added his ridiculously great guitar solos to the song, our version gradually moved toward completion.\n\nWas Patrick's Epic arrangement and hard-practice rap of metalhead successful? I hope you check it out for yourself!\n\nK/DA - The Baddest (EPIC METAL COVER)\n\nSiegfried Song (Symmetric Chaos, South Korea) - Vocals, Mixing, Mastering, Video Editing \nPatrick Fallang (Symmetric Chaos, Norway) - Guitars, Drums, Music Arrangement, Premixing\n\n►Spotify\nAvailable Soon\n\n►iTunes\nAvailable Soon\n\n►Google Play\nAvailable Soon\n\n#BADDEST #KDA #LOL #KPOP #PowerMetal",
