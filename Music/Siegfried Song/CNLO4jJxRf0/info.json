After I came back from Sweden, I decided to spend time with my family for a year. I have finally returned to my music production while also spending time on numerous covers and originals.\n\nI got an opportunity to work with David Olivares, a young promising guitarist from Chile. You should also check out his dedicated collaborations with lots of musicians on his youtube channel. \n\nAbout a month ago, while we recorded this Stratovarius cover, I thought it would sound even better to add a little more perfection for my long awaited fans, so I asked Alex Nasla if we could make some enhancements to the sound with his gorgeous fingers :P And here it is!\n\nWe put a lot of effort into this and I believe this could be an enjoyable way to end your year. Alex and I will be back with original material on February. We may also have a couple more covers with David. Until that time, stay tuned!\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy New Year!\n\nGuitars - David Olivares\nKeyboards  - Alex Nasla\nVocals - Siegfried Song\nSound Designs - Alex Nasla, David Olivares\nPremixing - David Olivares\nMixing and Mastering - Siegfried Song\nFilming - Eli Lee, Adam Nasla\nVideo Editing - Siegfried Song",
