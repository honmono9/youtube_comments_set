Thanks for your supports!\n\nDuring my high school days, Helloween and Gamma Ray were always on my playlist. \nIt may be an unfamiliar band for young metal fans, but this is one of the bands that have led me to become a metalhead with their overwhelming intense power, and I believe their songs need to be rediscovered. \n\nKai Hansen is known as one of the best guitarist and best songwriter in the metal scene. But I respect him because of the way he delivers his energy through his voice. On this song you can see his true charisma. This is the version we made as a tribute to his greatness and I hope this version reaches out Kai!\n\n►Spotify\nAvailable Soon\n\n►Google Play\nAvailable Soon\n\n►iTunes\nAvailable Soon\n\nGamma Ray - Last Before The Storm (Cover)\n\nSiegfried Song (Symmetric Chaos, South Korea) - Lead Vocals, Harmony Vocals and Video Editing\n'WEE' SungHun (MuTrickster, South Korea) - Rhythm and Lead Guitars\nLeo Peña (Jotun Studio, Spain) - Keyboards, Drum Programming, Mixing and Mastering\nHwang Myung (MuTrickster, South Korea) - Bass Guitars\n\n[Siegfried Song]\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SiegfriedSongOfficial\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SymmetricChaos/\n\n['WEE' SungHun]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/weesunghun\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sunghoon.wee.7\n\n[Leo Peña]\nhttps://www.jotunstudio.es   \nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/jotunstudio\nhttps://www.facebook.com/jotunstudio",
