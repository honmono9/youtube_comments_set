                "description": "Hello everyone,\n\nIt's been a while since my last update. I promised to work consistently on music this year, but unexpected challenges came up that delayed my work, and I apologize for keeping you waiting.\n\nI know many creators follow trends and put out content quickly, but that's never been my approach. I work with different standards and timelines than other YouTubers.\n\nUsually I work as part of a band with talented musicians, but this time circumstances led me to work solo with some technical assistance. Despite everything, I couldn't leave my fans waiting any longer, so I managed to complete this track during a brief creative break from my busy schedule.\nToday I'm presenting a metal cover of \"Golden\" by Huntr/x, the virtual band from K-Pop Demon Hunters series. I've reimagined the original with powerful metal elements while preserving its core essence.\n\nI was able to create the backing track with modern production tools, which I then enhanced with my vocals and video editing. Though this was a solo project, I put my heart into it with the desire to share something special with all of you.\n\nThank you for your continued support, and I promise more music is coming your way.\n\nCredits:\nSiegfried Song (SoniKhaos, South Korea) - Lead Vocals, Harmony Vocals, Video Editing & Arrangement\nOriginal Song: Huntr/x - Golden (from K-Pop Demon Hunters)\n\nPlease support with likes, subscriptions, and comments!\nWhat's your favorite part of this metal version?
