                "description": "Hello everyone,\n\nWe made a Hazbin Hotel cover years ago, but personal struggles kept me from releasing it. When I heard a new season was coming, I revisited the first season's soundtrack and realized there were so many great songs we never covered. This one immediately stood out.\n\nWorking on this piece allowed me to push my vocals further than before, refining every detail until it captured the emotions I wanted to convey. And when Patrick's arrangement brought it all together, it became something truly devastating.\n\nI'm incredibly proud of how this turned out!!\n\nCredits:\nVocals, Mixing & Mastering - Siegfried Song\nLead Guitar, Rhythm Guitar & Arrangement - Patrick Fallang\n\nPlease support with likes, subscriptions, and comments!\nWhat's your favorite part of this metal version? Let me know!\n\n#HazbinHotel #Poison #MetalCover #EpicMetal #VivziePop #SoniKhaos",
