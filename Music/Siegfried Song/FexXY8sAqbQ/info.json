                "description": "I wanted to be a vocalist that no one could imitate, and of course other singers my age couldn't easily get my attention. Yes, but Yannis, he was a little different. At a young age he was already at the top and his live performances were amazing. I take my hat’s off to him!\n\nWhen my friend Leo first recommended Beast In Black for the next cover song, I was a little questioned if I could sing this song well enough. The instrumental music and mixing were almost complete, but due to my unstable finances and poor physical condition, I had to admit that I couldn't sing this song right now. In the end, Patrick's Godlike Solo and Leo's solid mix hasn't been released for nearly seven months. But they waited for me without any complaints.\n\nFor a long time, I focused on resetting my life and recovering my body. Eventually I came back, and this song is the fruit of my efforts. I am now ready to fly again.\n\nMoney and health are also essential to music. But above all, we can't do music alone. I am grateful that I still have good friends.
