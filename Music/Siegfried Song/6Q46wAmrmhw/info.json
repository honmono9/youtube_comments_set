I think Billie has such unique broken female allure which was almost impossible for me to imitate it. Although this was not exactly what I imagined, I could not let my crew wait any longer, so I had to be satisfied with this. Regardless my attempt was successful or not but it was very funny experimental anyway. Hope I have another time to do this.
