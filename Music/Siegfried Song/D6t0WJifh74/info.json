                "description": "First time I rented this video at the video store, I was 6 years old. Not like other Korean children, I was so fascinated with the gold cloths and pegasus, I couldn’t stop watching the entire series. However, at that time not every episodes were imported in Korea so I had no chance to know the ending of the anime. Then two decades later I’ve got some chance to watch the original one and suprisingly the Japanese opening was the same with the Korean version which I had in my mind so long. I guess I’m the probably one of rare YouTubers who has actually a great memory of this song. So, finally, I release my version today, I hope you enjoy the version I dreamed of.\n\n►Spotify\nAvailable Soon\n\n►Google Play\nAvailable Soon\n\n►iTunes\nAvailable Soon\n\nSaint Seiya | 聖闘士星矢 - Pegasus Fantasy (Metal Remix by SIEG)\n\nSiegfried Song (Symmetric Chaos, South Korea) - Lead Vocals, Harmony Vocals and Video Editing\n'WEE' Shawn (MuTrickster, South Korea) - Rhythm and Lead Guitars\nLeo Peña (Jotun Studio, Spain) - Keyboards, Bass, Drum Programming, Mixing, Mastering and Producing",
