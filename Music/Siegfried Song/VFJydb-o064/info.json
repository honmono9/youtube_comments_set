However, since this song was not officially released and was used as a background sound in animation, it was very difficult to recognize many parts such as musical instruments and lyrics. So I just sang as I heard without lyrics and recorded and the result was successful. e got a hot response from its fans. \n\nTime passed and finally the official album came out, and I re-recorded this song based on the official lyrics; surprisingly, the lyrics were English, not Japanese or German, contrary to our expectations.\nUnfortunately, the Friedrich hard disk has failed and the new recorded version was not completed. I've been hoping for a long time to get his hard disk fixed, but as of today I'm releasing our unfinished version here. I'm sorry for the incomplete instrumental and mixing, but I hope you enjoy this version. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/kEkCcfjiT_Y (Our Previous Cover)\n\nAbandoned Project 05\nAttack On Titan - Apple Seed (Covered in 2020)\n\nBesides the band album, I’ve been releasing music works just little by little, but there are not so many projects given to the audience in the 12 years since I started YouTube.\n\nSometimes I couldn't make my instrumental track, my songs weren't up to the level of publication, or problems with other musicians.\n\nThere are countless songs that haven't seen the light regardless of the cover and the original.\n\nHowever, something triggered me to start thinking that I should approach the listener more even with my incomplete work.\n\nNow I take my courage to open my imperfect voice that I never share before.\n\nIt's little bit more aggressive than the original version and it's been also my intention to make this cover an individual thing and not a direct copy of the original vocals.
