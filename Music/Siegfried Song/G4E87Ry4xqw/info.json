                "description": "Siegfried Song Facebook : http://www.facebook.com/SiegfriedSong...\nSymmetric Chaos Facebook : http://www.facebook.com/SymmetricChaos\n\nOne day, one of my friends in high school brought a Stratovarius CD to my class room and asked if I would like to try their songs. Since then, I have had tremendous fantasies about Scandinavian countries and their music. Six years later, I finally got the opportunity to travel to Scandinavia, and in Finland, my final destination, I could see how much they love metal. Even in Karaoke, they enjoyed singing metal. So it wasn't too difficult to get some Metal karaoke album before I left the country. In my embrace, 3 DVDs called Heavy Karaoke, I returned to Korea and I was super excited to sing all the songs on the DVDs. This is one of the first songs I recorded from that DVD.\n\nAbandoned Project 03\nSonata Arctica - Tallulah (Covered in 2008)\n\nBesides the band album, I’ve been releasing music works just little by little, but there are not so many projects given to the audience in the 12 years since I started YouTube.\n\nSometimes I couldn't make my instrumental track, my songs weren't up to the level of publication, or problems with other musicians.\n\nThere are countless songs that haven't seen the light regardless of the cover and the original.\n\nHowever, something triggered me to start thinking that I should approach the listener more even with my incomplete work.\n\nNow I take my courage to open my imperfect voice that I never share before.\n\nIt's little bit more aggressive than the original version and it's been also my intention to make this cover an individual thing and not a direct copy of the original vocals. It's up to you to decide whether the attempt has been successful or not.\n\nIf you like this song, please visit my facebook page.\nThank You.",
