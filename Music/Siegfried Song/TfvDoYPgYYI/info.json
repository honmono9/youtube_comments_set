I used to just imitate his vocals at that time but since my vocalization has changed a lot from the days, so it’s been very challenging to relive the old style while adding some of my originality. In fact, I cried several times because I couldn't get my voice out but I made it and here is the result.\n\nI am so grateful for Daniel's wonderful track.
