But at that time, there was no video contains my performance. So for the shoot, me and my friends planned a show, and first we had to write new vocal melodies and lyrics. But since I was in middle of semester, I had little time to prepare. On the day of the performance, the song was not completed, and we went on stage without practicing properly. And we made TONS of mistakes. I was so ashamed of the show then I didn't reveal this video to anyone. From then on, I was obsessed with perfectionism and was too harsh on myself, and I wasn't happy at all while doing music stuff that I loved. By releasing this video today, I am trying to forgive my immature but proud past.\n\nIf you like this song despite my mistakes, I'll make a recorded version of it again!
