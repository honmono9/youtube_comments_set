Help keep the party going!\nhttps://tiptopjar.com/TwistedMusicStudio\n\nLyrics:\nHave you got colour in your cheeks?\nDo you ever get that fear that you can't shift\nThe type that sticks around like summat in your teeth?\nAre there some aces up your sleeve?\nHave you no idea that you're in deep?\nI dreamt about you nearly every night this week\nHow many secrets can you keep?\n'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat\nUntil I fall asleep\nSpilling drinks on my settee\n\n(Do I wanna know?)\nIf this feeling flows both ways?\n(Sad to see you go)\nWas sort of hoping that you'd stay\n(Baby, we both know)\nThat the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day\n\nCrawling back to you\n\nEver thought of calling when you've had a few?\n'Cause I always do\nMaybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new\nNow I've thought it through\n\nCrawling back to you\n\nSo have you got the guts?\nBeen wondering if your heart's still open and if so I wanna know what time it shuts\nSimmer down and pucker up\nI'm sorry to interrupt. It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you\nI don't know if you feel the same as I do\nBut we could be together if you wanted to\n\n(Do I wanna know?)\nIf this feeling flows both ways?\n(Sad to see you go)\nWas sort of hoping that you'd stay\n(Baby, we both know)\nThat the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day\n\nCrawling back to you (crawling back to you)\n\nEver thought of calling when you've had a few? (you've had a few)\n'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)\nMaybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy) busy being yours to fall for somebody new\nNow I've thought it through\n\nCrawling back to you\n\n(Do I wanna know?)\nIf this feeling flows both ways?\n(Sad to see you go)\nWas sort of hoping that you'd stay\n(Baby, we both know)\nThat the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day\n\n(Do I wanna know?)\nToo busy being yours to fall\n(Sad to see you go)\nEver thought of calling darling?\n(Do I wanna know?)\nDo you want me crawling back to you?",
