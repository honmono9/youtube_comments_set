While the circumstances of Frost's text led to the creation of Whitacre and Silvestri's first beloved collaboration, this new version offers the chance to hear the music in a completely different light.\n\nPurchase the music: https://giamusic.com/resource/stopping-by-woods-on-a-snowy-evening-printed-music-wjms1232\n\n#WaltonMusic #ChoralMusic #MixedChoir #EricWhitacre #RobertFrost",
