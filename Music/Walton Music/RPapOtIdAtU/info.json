                "description": "We Shall Overcome arranged by Robert T. Gibson. This piece is for SATB choirs with solo. \n\nRobert T. Gibson's setting of We Shall Overcome is dynamic and well-crafted. Attention has been paid to the construction of the vocals, which throughout the work act as accompaniment to the soloist. Requires an accomplished soloist and a strong choir. A beautiful sentiment for our times.\n\nPurchase the music: https://www.giamusic.com/store/resource/we-shall-overcome-print-ww1727\n\n#WeShallOvercome #Choral #WaltonMusic",
