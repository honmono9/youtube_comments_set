It is scored for unaccompanied SATB choir with divisi. \n\nThe timeless message is reharmonized and adapted for a contemporary audience. This hymn and its setting will be a good fit for capable church choirs along with community and collegiate-level ensembles.\n\nPerformance by Transept, conducted by Timothy J.
