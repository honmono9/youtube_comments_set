Let's use both a dark-sounding type of scale and a light-sounding type of scale to express this. Then check how they sound with the chord. Once you are comfortable with it, practice playing it with fewer notes, then play it melodically.\nWatch this video over and over again and practice hard so you can enjoy improvising!\n\n◾️Bb Mixolydian Scale\nBb C D Eb F G Ab Bb\n\n◾️C Minor Pentatonic Scale\nC Eb F G Bb C\n\nChoose your favorite backing track and use it for solo practice, chord backing, and bassline practice.It's a lot of fun when you can copy and play your favorite tracks!\nAll the tracks are composed, played, recorded and mixed by us.You will also learn how to mix and mastering tracks!And if you like it, please subscribe to the channel.\nLet's get started !!\n\n\n【 Mid Slow Funk Funk Jam Eb Major BPM90 BackingTrack 】\n\nAll Instruments version 【For Vocal, Guitar, Bass, Drum, Piano, Sax】\n▷https://youtu.be/fUo5GKPjmco\n\nNo Guitar version【For Guitar】\n▷https://youtu.be/SmntCRzWZwI\n\nNo Bass version【For Bass】\n▷https://youtu.be/Y7oFUkUH9ig\n\nNo Piano version【For Piano】\n▷https://youtu.be/6KgR_vI65Jc\n\nNo Drums version【For Drums】\n▷https://youtu.be/Dd0QqGyRtfM\n\n\n【How to practice】\nListen to the full version first to see the chord movements and bassline phrases of your instrument, then practice with the minus one-track sound source for each instrument.When you have a cool pattern, please upload it to YouTube.We always check the video.
