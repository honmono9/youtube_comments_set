We put a lot of heart into every note, hoping to capture its beauty and emotion.\n\nWe invite you to listen and let yourself be carried away by its magic. We truly hope you enjoy it as much as we did while playing it! 💛🎻🎹\n\n✬ ABOUT THIS RECORDING ✬\n\nI am Mu Dimon, the pianist behind Songs of Birdland.
