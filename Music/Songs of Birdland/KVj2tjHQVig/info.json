                "description": "Today we’re happy to share this cozy collection of soft jazz pieces created especially for babies and their families. We wanted the music to feel warm, gentle, and soothing. The kind of sound that makes quiet moments even more peaceful and helps little ones feel safe and relaxed.\n\nThese pieces were put together with a lot of care, keeping in mind those tender everyday moments: cuddling on the couch, winding down after a long day, or simply filling the room with a calm, comforting atmosphere. Our hope is that this gentle jazz brings a sense of ease to your home and becomes a soft companion during your baby’s calm moments.\n\nThank you for inviting this music into your space. We hope it brings comfort, warmth, and a little bit of joy to you and your little one. 💛🎷✨\n\n00:00 Rainy nap\n03:25 You made me love you\n05:36 Bee be big\n09:55 Beale Street Blues\n12:58 Crawling in the sky\n16:17 Indian Summer\n18:37 Elephant's dream\n21:42 Oliver\n24:25 Fare Thee Well\n27:47 Poor butterfly\n31:31 Find me\n35:49 The Dino, the Lullaby and Paco\n40:12 Lolaby\n43:13 Whispering\n45:09 Strolling around\n48:55 Sunny Winter Seagull\n51:53 Swinging morning\n56:57 Unwrapping day\n58:44 Rainy nap\n01:02:09 You made me love you\n\n✬ OUR LAST ALBUM  ✬\n\n✨ Bach: Piano Lullabies ✨\n\nSPOTIFY : https://shorturl.at/0K6y4\nAMAZON MUSIC: https://shorturl.at/YaQzI\nDEEZER: https://shorturl.at/orpvz\n\n✬ ABOUT US ✬\n\nWe are Mu Dimon and Rubio Faviere, the musicians behind Songs of Birdland.
