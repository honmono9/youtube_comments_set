                "description": "Today we share a softer side of Frédéric Chopin, reimagined for little ears and quiet moments. His nocturnes and waltzes, known for their lyrical beauty and emotional depth, become gentle lullabies in this collection offering comfort, tenderness and calm. \n\nEach melody flows like a quiet embrace, creating a peaceful atmosphere perfect for bedtime, cuddles or simply resting together. Because even the most refined classical music can become a shared sanctuary of warmth and serenity.​\n\nWe hope you like it :)\n\n00:00 Etude Op.10 No.3 in E Major 'Tristesse'\n​01:49 Waltz No.11 in G-Flat Major, Op.Posth 70 No.1\n​04:00 Waltz No.12 in F Minor, Op.Posth 70 No.2\n​07:50 Waltz No.13 in D-Flat Major, Op.Posth 70 No.3\n​11:06 Waltz ​No.18 in E- Flat Major, KK IVb No.10\n​12:58 Waltz No.19 in A minor, B.150\n​15:30 Nocturne ​ No.2 in E-flat major​, Op.9 No.2\n​19:56 Nocturne No.20 in C​-Sharp minor, Op. ​Posth.
