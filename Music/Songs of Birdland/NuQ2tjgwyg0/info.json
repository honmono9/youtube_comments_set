                "description": "We're very happy to share with you something truly special: our new album, Chopin: Before the Dawn. This video brings together all the pieces included in the album, among them Étude Op.10 No.3 “Tristesse,” Nocturne Op.9 No.2, Waltzes Op.64 and Op.69, and other works that have shaped my life as a pianist.\n\nFor me, Chopin’s music has always felt like a quiet conversation with the soul, full of longing, tenderness, and a fragile light that appears just before dawn. Recording this album was an intimate journey, and I hope these performances bring you calm, inspiration, and a space where your emotions can breathe.\n\nToday I also want to introduce you to our brand-new YouTube channel: Classical of Birdland, a place created with love for everyone who finds comfort and beauty in classical music. My hope is to build a warm and inspiring community where we can share performances, discoveries, and meaningful musical moments together.\n\nThank you for being here and for supporting this new beginning.\n\nIf this music resonates with you, we would be truly grateful if you subscribed and joined our growing community.\n\nWith love,\nMu Dimon and Rubio Faviere\n\n\nThank you for listening and for always being there! 🌱🌟\n\n✬ OUR LAST ALBUM  ✬\n\n✨ Bach: Piano Lullabies ✨\n\nSPOTIFY : https://shorturl.at/0K6y4\nAMAZON MUSIC: https://shorturl.at/YaQzI\nDEEZER: https://shorturl.at/orpvz\n\n✬ ABOUT US ✬\n\nWe are Mu Dimon and Rubio Faviere, the musicians behind Songs of Birdland.
