As the video continues, you’ll also hear two other original works by Rubio Faviere, specially composed for Songs of Birdland and lovingly dedicated to our two children. These pieces were originally written for jazz ensemble, and I have adapted them for solo piano to create a soft, soothing experience perfect for little ears.\n\nLater in the video, you’ll find my arrangements of Mozart’s orchestral works, reimagined for solo piano, as well as my interpretations of Mozart’s original piano sonatas, carefully selected to bring calm and comfort at bedtime. :)\n\nIdeal for bedtime, naps, or quiet family moments.\n\nI hope it brings calm and sweet dreams 💤\n\n00:00 La pesca - From the movie 'Bernabéu' composed by Antonio Fernández (Rubio Faviere)\n04:41 Lolaby - Rubio Faviere - Arr.
